Currently, the solidity compiler will not return a warning for effect-free code. This can lead to the introduction of \\\"dead\\\" code that does not properly perform an intended action.\\n\\nFor example, it's easy to miss the trailing parentheses in `msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance)(\\\"\\\");`, which could lead to a function proceeding without transferring funds to `msg.sender`. Although, this should be avoided by [checking the return value of the call](./SWC-104.md).\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt's important to carefully ensure that your contract works as intended. Write  unit tests to verify correct behaviour of the code.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Issue on Solidity's Github - raise an error when a statement can never have side-effects](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2707)\\n- [Issue on Solidity's Github - msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance); should produce a warning](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7096)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### deposit_box.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract DepositBox {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Accept deposit\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'incorrect amount');\\n        // Should update user balance\\n        balance[msg.sender] == amount;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### deposit_box_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract DepositBox {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Accept deposit\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'incorrect amount');\\n        // Should update user balance\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### wallet.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract Wallet {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Deposit funds in contract\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'msg.value must be equal to amount');\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Withdraw funds from contract\\n    function withdraw(uint amount) public {\\n        require(amount <= balance[msg.sender], 'amount must be less than balance');\\n\\n        uint previousBalance = balance[msg.sender];\\n        balance[msg.sender] = previousBalance - amount;\\n\\n        // Attempt to send amount from the contract to msg.sender\\n        msg.sender.call.value(amount);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### wallet_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract Wallet {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Deposit funds in contract\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'msg.value must be equal to amount');\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Withdraw funds from contract\\n    function withdraw(uint amount) public {\\n        require(amount <= balance[msg.sender], 'amount must be less than balance');\\n\\n        uint previousBalance = balance[msg.sender];\\n        balance[msg.sender] = previousBalance - amount;\\n\\n        // Attempt to send amount from the contract to msg.sender\\n        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amount)(\\\"\\\");\\n        require(success, 'transfer failed');\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n# Please note, this content is no longer actively maintained.\\n\\nThe content of the SWC registry has not been thoroughly updated since 2020.

For instance if a number is stored in the uint8 type, it means that the number is stored in a 8 bits unsigned number ranging from 0 to 2^8-1. In computer programming, an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits â€“ either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt is recommended to use vetted safe math libraries for arithmetic operations consistently throughout the smart contract system.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices -

In the reentrancy attack (a.k.a. recursive call attack), a malicious contract calls back into the calling contract before the first invocation of the function is finished. This may cause the different invocations of the function to interact in undesirable ways.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nThe best practices to avoid Reentrancy weaknesses are:\\n\\n- Make sure all internal state changes are performed before the call is executed. This is known as the [Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security-considerations.html#use-the-checks-effects-interactions-pattern)\\n- Use a reentrancy lock (ie.

Currently, the solidity compiler will not return a warning for effect-free code. This can lead to the introduction of \\\"dead\\\" code that does not properly perform an intended action.\\n\\nFor example, it's easy to miss the trailing parentheses in `msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance)(\\\"\\\");`, which could lead to a function proceeding without transferring funds to `msg.sender`. Although, this should be avoided by [checking the return value of the call](./SWC-104.md).\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt's important to carefully ensure that your contract works as intended. Write  unit tests to verify correct behaviour of the code.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Issue on Solidity's Github - raise an error when a statement can never have side-effects](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2707)\\n- [Issue on Solidity's Github - msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance); should produce a warning](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7096)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### deposit_box.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract DepositBox {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Accept deposit\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'incorrect amount');\\n        // Should update user balance\\n        balance[msg.sender] == amount;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### deposit_box_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract DepositBox {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Accept deposit\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'incorrect amount');\\n        // Should update user balance\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### wallet.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract Wallet {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Deposit funds in contract\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'msg.value must be equal to amount');\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Withdraw funds from contract\\n    function withdraw(uint amount) public {\\n        require(amount <= balance[msg.sender], 'amount must be less than balance');\\n\\n        uint previousBalance = balance[msg.sender];\\n        balance[msg.sender] = previousBalance - amount;\\n\\n        // Attempt to send amount from the contract to msg.sender\\n        msg.sender.call.value(amount);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### wallet_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract Wallet {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Deposit funds in contract\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'msg.value must be equal to amount');\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Withdraw funds from contract\\n    function withdraw(uint amount) public {\\n        require(amount <= balance[msg.sender], 'amount must be less than balance');\\n\\n        uint previousBalance = balance[msg.sender];\\n        balance[msg.sender] = previousBalance - amount;\\n\\n        // Attempt to send amount from the contract to msg.sender\\n        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amount)(\\\"\\\");\\n        require(success, 'transfer failed');\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n# Please note, this content is no longer actively maintained.\\n\\nThe content of the SWC registry has not been thoroughly updated since 2020.

For instance if a number is stored in the uint8 type, it means that the number is stored in a 8 bits unsigned number ranging from 0 to 2^8-1. In computer programming, an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits â€“ either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt is recommended to use vetted safe math libraries for arithmetic operations consistently throughout the smart contract system.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices -

In the reentrancy attack (a.k.a. recursive call attack), a malicious contract calls back into the calling contract before the first invocation of the function is finished. This may cause the different invocations of the function to interact in undesirable ways.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nThe best practices to avoid Reentrancy weaknesses are:\\n\\n- Make sure all internal state changes are performed before the call is executed. This is known as the [Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security-considerations.html#use-the-checks-effects-interactions-pattern)\\n- Use a reentrancy lock (ie.  [OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol)).\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices -

In the reentrancy attack (a.k.a. recursive call attack), a malicious contract calls back into the calling contract before the first invocation of the function is finished. This may cause the different invocations of the function to interact in undesirable ways.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nThe best practices to avoid Reentrancy weaknesses are:\\n\\n- Make sure all internal state changes are performed before the call is executed. This is known as the [Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security-considerations.html#use-the-checks-effects-interactions-pattern)\\n- Use a reentrancy lock (ie.

Currently, the solidity compiler will not return a warning for effect-free code. This can lead to the introduction of \\\"dead\\\" code that does not properly perform an intended action.\\n\\nFor example, it's easy to miss the trailing parentheses in `msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance)(\\\"\\\");`, which could lead to a function proceeding without transferring funds to `msg.sender`. Although, this should be avoided by [checking the return value of the call](./SWC-104.md).\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt's important to carefully ensure that your contract works as intended.

Historically, it has often been recommended to use these functions for value transfers to guard against reentrancy attacks. However, the gas cost of EVM instructions may change significantly during hard forks which may break already deployed contract systems that make fixed assumptions about gas costs.  For example. [EIP 1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884) broke several existing smart contracts due to a cost increase of the SLOAD instruction.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nAvoid the use of `transfer()` and `send()` and do not otherwise specify a fixed amount of gas when performing calls. Use `.call.value(...)(\\\"\\\")` instead. Use the checks-effects-interactions pattern and/or reentrancy locks to prevent reentrancy attacks.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [ChainSecurity - Ethereum Istanbul Hardfork: The Security Perspective](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IiRYSjwle02zQUmWId06Bss8GrxGyw6nQAiZdCRFEPk/)\\n- [Steve Marx - Stop Using Solidityâ€™s transfer() Now\\n  ](https://diligence.consensys.net/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/)\\n- [EIP 1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### hardcoded_gas_limits.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Bernhard Mueller (ConsenSys / MythX)\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity 0.6.4;\\n\\ninterface ICallable {\\n\\tfunction callMe() external;\\n}\\n\\ncontract HardcodedNotGood {\\n\\n    address payable _callable = 0xaAaAaAaaAaAaAaaAaAAAAAAAAaaaAaAaAaaAaaAa;\\n\\tICallable callable = ICallable(_callable);\\n\\n\\tconstructor() public payable {\\n\\t}\\n\\n    function doTransfer(uint256 amount) public {\\n        _callable.transfer(amount);\\n    }\\n\\n    function doSend(uint256 amount) public {\\n    \\t_callable.send(amount);\\n    }\\n\\n     function callLowLevel() public {\\n         _callable.call.value(0).gas(10000)(\\\"\\\");\\n     }\\n\\n     function callWithArgs() public {\\n         callable.callMe{gas: 10000}();\\n     }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\"\n",

This may cause the different invocations of the function to interact in undesirable ways.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nThe best practices to avoid Reentrancy weaknesses are:\\n\\n- Make sure all internal state changes are performed before the call is executed. This is known as the [Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security-considerations.html#use-the-checks-effects-interactions-pattern)\\n- Use a reentrancy lock (ie.

Although, this should be avoided by [checking the return value of the call](./SWC-104.md).\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt's important to carefully ensure that your contract works as intended.

Historically, it has often been recommended to use these functions for value transfers to guard against reentrancy attacks. However, the gas cost of EVM instructions may change significantly during hard forks which may break already deployed contract systems that make fixed assumptions about gas costs.  For example. [EIP 1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884) broke several existing smart contracts due to a cost increase of the SLOAD instruction.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nAvoid the use of `transfer()` and `send()` and do not otherwise specify a fixed amount of gas when performing calls. Use `.call.value(...)(\\\"\\\")` instead. Use the checks-effects-interactions pattern and/or reentrancy locks to prevent reentrancy attacks.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [ChainSecurity - Ethereum Istanbul Hardfork: The Security Perspective](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IiRYSjwle02zQUmWId06Bss8GrxGyw6nQAiZdCRFEPk/)\\n- [Steve Marx - Stop Using Solidityâ€™s transfer() Now\\n  ](https://diligence.consensys.net/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/)\\n- [EIP 1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### hardcoded_gas_limits.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Bernhard Mueller (ConsenSys / MythX)\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity 0.6.4;\\n\\ninterface ICallable {\\n\\tfunction callMe() external;\\n}\\n\\ncontract HardcodedNotGood {\\n\\n    address payable _callable = 0xaAaAaAaaAaAaAaaAaAAAAAAAAaaaAaAaAaaAaaAa;\\n\\tICallable callable = ICallable(_callable);\\n\\n\\tconstructor() public payable {\\n\\t}\\n\\n    function doTransfer(uint256 amount) public {\\n        _callable.transfer(amount);\\n    }\\n\\n    function doSend(uint256 amount) public {\\n    \\t_callable.send(amount);\\n    }\\n\\n     function callLowLevel() public {\\n         _callable.call.value(0).gas(10000)(\\\"\\\");\\n     }\\n\\n     function callWithArgs() public {\\n         callable.callMe{gas: 10000}();\\n     }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n- TARGET SOLIDITY CODE TO ANALYZE:\\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\\n\\ncontract PiggyBank is ReentrancyGuard {\\n    mapping(address => uint) public credit;\\n\\n    function deposit() public payable {\\n        credit[msg.sender] += msg.value;\\n    }\\n\\n    function withdraw(uint amount) public nonReentrant {\\n        require(credit[msg.sender] >= amount, \\\"Insufficient balance\\\");\\n        \\n        credit[msg.sender] -= amount; \\n        \\n        (bool success,) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: amount}(\\\"\\\");\\n        require(success, \\\"Transfer failed\\\");\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\\nFIRST, OUTPUT A CHAIN OF THOUGHT THAT EXPLAINS YOUR ANALYSIS STEP-BY-STEP.\\n\\nTHEN RETURN A COMPREHENSIVE JSON ARRAY where EACH DETECTED ISSUE follows THIS STRUCTURE:\\n[\\n  {\\n    \\\"line\\\": \\\"LINE NUMBER WHERE ISSUE OCCURS\\\",\\n    \\\"token\\\": \\\"EXACT PROBLEMATIC CODE SNIPPET\\\",\\n    \\\"problem\\\": \\\"CONCISE NAME OF THE ISSUE\\\",\\n    \\\"severity\\\": \\\"low | medium | high\\\",\\n    \\\"explanation\\\": \\\"DETAILED REASON WHY THIS IS A PROBLEM INCLUDING POTENTIAL IMPACT\\\",\\n    \\\"migration\\\": \\\"CLEAR AND ACTIONABLE INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO FIX OR MITIGATE THIS ISSUE\\\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n### CHAIN OF THOUGHTS TO APPLY ###\\nFOLLOW THIS STEP-BY-STEP LOGIC TO GUIDE YOUR ANALYSIS:\\n\\n1. UNDERSTAND:\\n   - Number all lines of code for precise referencing.\\n   - Carefully read the known vulnerabilities context.\\n   - Comprehend the functionality and purpose of the target Solidity code.\\n\\n2. BASICS:\\n   - Identify basic security risks: access control, reentrancy, overflows, gas inefficiencies, visibility issues, and unchecked calls.\\n\\n3. BREAK DOWN:\\n   - Divide the code into logical sections (constructors, functions, modifiers, inheritance).\\n   - Observe how state variables are used and whether external interactions are properly handled.\\n\\n4. ANALYZE:\\n   - Inspect each section for known vulnerabilities and suspicious or undocumented patterns.\\n   - Check if patterns like Checks-Effects-Interactions, proper error handling, and safe math are followed.\\n\\n5. BUILD:\\n   - Assemble findings into a clear list of issues using the specified JSON format.\\n\\n6. EDGE CASES:\\n   - Consider compiler version quirks, timestamp and block manipulation, and gas griefing attacks.\\n   - Think about permission escalation or external dependency risks.\\n\\n7. OUTPUT:\\n   - Start by explaining how each issue was discovered using a step-by-step thought process (CHAIN OF THOUGHT).\\n   - Then provide a complete, well-formatted JSON array with no missing fields.\\n\\n### WHAT NOT TO DO ###\\n- DO NOT provide vague or incomplete issue descriptions.\\n- DO NOT ignore low-severity vulnerabilities.\\n- DO NOT omit migration/fix instructions, even for minor issues.\\n- DO NOT output free-text paragraphs outside of the JSON structure.\\n- DO NOT skip the CHAIN OF THOUGHT section before listing issues.\\n- DO NOT forget to escape quotes in JSON.\\n\\n### EXAMPLES OF GOOD DETECTIONS ###\\n[\\n  {\\n    \\\"line\\\": \\\"42\\\",\\n    \\\"token\\\": \\\"to.call{value: amount}(\\\\\\\"\\\")\\\",\\n    \\\"problem\\\": \\\"Reentrancy Vulnerability\\\",\\n    \\\"severity\\\": \\\"high\\\",\\n    \\\"explanation\\\": \\\"The contract makes an external call to transfer ETH before updating the internal state (credit[msg.sender]), which can be exploited through reentrancy attacks by malicious contracts.\\\",\\n    \\\"migration\\\": \\\"Use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern by reducing the user's credit balance before making the external call, or use `transfer` instead of `call`.\\\"\\n  },\\n  {\\n    \\\"line\\\": \\\"15\\\",\\n    \\\"token\\\": \\\"uint8 counter;\\\",\\n    \\\"problem\\\": \\\"Possible Overflow\\\",\\n    \\\"severity\\\": \\\"high\\\",\\n    \\\"explanation\\\": \\\"uint8 can easily overflow; Solidity 0.8+ reverts on overflow but caution still needed for explicit low types.\\\",\\n    \\\"migration\\\": \\\"Ensure careful increment operations or use SafeMath if below 0.8.\\\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\"\n",

For instance if a number is stored in the uint8 type, it means that the number is stored in a 8 bits unsigned number ranging from 0 to 2^8-1. In computer programming, an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits â€“ either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt is recommended to use vetted safe math libraries for arithmetic operations consistently throughout the smart contract system.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices -

Currently, the solidity compiler will not return a warning for effect-free code. This can lead to the introduction of \\\"dead\\\" code that does not properly perform an intended action.\\n\\nFor example, it's easy to miss the trailing parentheses in `msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance)(\\\"\\\");`, which could lead to a function proceeding without transferring funds to `msg.sender`. Although, this should be avoided by [checking the return value of the call](./SWC-104.md).\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt's important to carefully ensure that your contract works as intended.

For instance if a number is stored in the uint8 type, it means that the number is stored in a 8 bits unsigned number ranging from 0 to 2^8-1. In computer programming, an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits â€“ either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt is recommended to use vetted safe math libraries for arithmetic operations consistently throughout the smart contract system.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices -

Currently, the solidity compiler will not return a warning for effect-free code. This can lead to the introduction of \\\"dead\\\" code that does not properly perform an intended action.\\n\\nFor example, it's easy to miss the trailing parentheses in `msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance)(\\\"\\\");`, which could lead to a function proceeding without transferring funds to `msg.sender`. Although, this should be avoided by [checking the return value of the call](./SWC-104.md).\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt's important to carefully ensure that your contract works as intended.

In the worst case scenario this could lead to DOS conditions that might render the contract unusable.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nAvoid strict equality checks for the Ether balance in a contract.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Consensys Best Practices: Force Feeding](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/attacks/force-feeding/)\\n- [Sigmaprime: Unexpected Ether](https://blog.sigmaprime.io/solidity-security.html#ether)\\n- [Gridlock (a smart contract bug)](https://medium.com/@nmcl/gridlock-a-smart-contract-bug-73b8310608a9)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### Lockdrop.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/**\\n * @source: https://github.com/hicommonwealth/edgeware-lockdrop/blob/93ecb524c9c88d25bab36278541f190fa9e910c2/contracts/Lockdrop.sol\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract Lock {\\n    // address owner;

This can\\nallow an attacker to corrupt the storage; for instance, by overwriting a field that stores\\nthe address of the contract owner.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nAs a general advice, given that all data structures share the same storage (address)\\nspace, one should make sure that writes to one data structure cannot inadvertently\\noverwrite entries of another data structure.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Entry to Underhanded Solidity Coding Contest 2017 (honorable mention)](https://github.com/Arachnid/uscc/tree/master/submissions-2017/doughoyte)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### arbitrary_location_write_simple.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.4.25;\\n\\ncontract Wallet {\\n    uint[] private bonusCodes;\\n    address private owner;\\n\\n    constructor() public {\\n        bonusCodes = new uint[](0);\\n        owner = msg.sender;\\n    }\\n\\n    function () public payable {\\n    }\\n\\n    function PushBonusCode(uint c) public {\\n        bonusCodes.push(c);\\n    }\\n\\n    function PopBonusCode() public {\\n        require(0 <= bonusCodes.length);\\n        bonusCodes.length--;\\n    }\\n\\n    function UpdateBonusCodeAt(uint idx, uint c) public {\\n        require(idx < bonusCodes.length);\\n        bonusCodes[idx] = c;\\n    }\\n\\n    function Destroy() public {\\n        require(msg.sender == owner);\\n        selfdestruct(msg.sender);\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n### arbitrary_location_write_simple_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.4.25;\\n\\ncontract Wallet {\\n    uint[] private bonusCodes;\\n    address private owner;\\n\\n    constructor() public {\\n        bonusCodes = new uint[](0);\\n        owner = msg.sender;\\n    }\\n\\n    function () public payable {\\n    }\\n\\n    function PushBonusCode(uint c) public {\\n        bonusCodes.push(c);\\n    }\\n\\n    function PopBonusCode() public {\\n        require(0 < bonusCodes.length);\\n        bonusCodes.length--;\\n    }\\n\\n    function UpdateBonusCodeAt(uint idx, uint c) public {\\n        require(idx < bonusCodes.length); //Since you now have to push very codes this is no longer an arbitray write.\\n        bonusCodes[idx] = c;\\n    }\\n\\n    function Destroy() public {\\n        require(msg.sender == owner);\\n        selfdestruct(msg.sender);\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n### mapping_write.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\\n\\n//This code is derived from the Capture the Ether https://capturetheether.com/challenges/math/mapping/\\n\\ncontract Map {\\n    address public owner;\\n    uint256[] map;\\n\\n    function set(uint256 key, uint256 value) public {\\n        if (map.length <= key) {\\n            map.length = key + 1;\\n        }\\n\\n        map[key] = value;\\n    }\\n\\n    function get(uint256 key) public view returns (uint256) {\\n        return map[key];\\n    }\\n    function withdraw() public{\\n      require(msg.sender == owner);\\n      msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n# Please note, this content is no longer actively maintained.\\n\\nThe content of the SWC registry has not been thoroughly updated since 2020.

For instance if a number is stored in the uint8 type, it means that the number is stored in a 8 bits unsigned number ranging from 0 to 2^8-1. In computer programming, an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits â€“ either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt is recommended to use vetted safe math libraries for arithmetic operations consistently throughout the smart contract system.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices -

For instance if a number is stored in the uint8 type, it means that the number is stored in a 8 bits unsigned number ranging from 0 to 2^8-1. In computer programming, an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits â€“ either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt is recommended to use vetted safe math libraries for arithmetic operations consistently throughout the smart contract system.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices -

Miners review the transactions they have received and select which ones to include in a block, based on who has paid a high enough gas price to be included. Additionally, when transactions are sent to the Ethereum network, they are forwarded to each node for processing. Thus, a person who is running an Ethereum node can tell which transactions are going to occur before they are finalized. A race condition vulnerability occurs when code depends on the order of the transactions submitted to it.\\n\\nThe simplest example of a race condition is when a smart contract gives a reward for submitting information. Suppose a contract will give out 1 token to the first person who solves a math problem. Alice solves the problem and submits the answer to the network with a standard gas price. Eve runs an Ethereum node and can see the answer to the math problem in the transaction that Alice submitted to the network. So, Eve submits the answer to the network with a much higher gas price, and thus it gets processed and committed before Alice's transaction. Eve receives one token, and Alice gets nothing, even though it was Alice who worked to solve the problem. A common way this occurs in practice is when a contract rewards people for calling out bad behavior in a protocol by giving a bad actor's deposit to the person who proved they were misbehaving.\\n\\nThe race condition that happens most frequently on the network today is the race condition in the ERC20 token standard. The ERC20 token standard includes a function called 'approve', which allows an address to approve another address to spend tokens on their behalf. Assume that Alice has approved Eve to spend n of her tokens, then Alice decides to change Eve's approval to m tokens. Alice submits a function call to approve with the value n for Eve. Eve runs an Ethereum node, so she knows that Alice is going to change her approval to m. Eve then submits a transferFrom request, sending n of Alice's tokens to herself, but gives it a much higher gas price than Alice's transaction. The transferFrom executes first so gives Eve n tokens and sets Eve's approval to zero. Then Alice's transaction executes and sets Eve's approval to m. Eve then sends those m tokens to herself as well. Thus, Eve gets n + m tokens, even though she should have gotten at most max(n,m).\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nA possible way to remedy race conditions in the submission of information in exchange for a reward is called a commit reveal hash scheme. Instead of submitting the answer, the party who has the answer submits hash(salt, address, answer) \\\\[salt being some number of their choosing\\\\]; the contract stores this hash and the sender's address. To claim the reward, the sender then submits a transaction with the salt, and answer. The contract hashes (salt, msg.sender, answer) and checks the hash produced against the stored hash. If the hash matches, the contract releases the reward.\\n\\nThe best fix for the ERC20 race condition is to add a field to the inputs of approve, which is the expected current value, and to have approve revert if Eve's current allowance is not what Alice indicated she was expecting. However, this means that your contract no longer conforms to the ERC20 standard. If it is important to your project to have the contract conform to ERC20, you can add a safe approve function.

Miners review the transactions they have received and select which ones to include in a block, based on who has paid a high enough gas price to be included. Additionally, when transactions are sent to the Ethereum network, they are forwarded to each node for processing. Thus, a person who is running an Ethereum node can tell which transactions are going to occur before they are finalized. A race condition vulnerability occurs when code depends on the order of the transactions submitted to it.\\n\\nThe simplest example of a race condition is when a smart contract gives a reward for submitting information. Suppose a contract will give out 1 token to the first person who solves a math problem. Alice solves the problem and submits the answer to the network with a standard gas price. Eve runs an Ethereum node and can see the answer to the math problem in the transaction that Alice submitted to the network. So, Eve submits the answer to the network with a much higher gas price, and thus it gets processed and committed before Alice's transaction. Eve receives one token, and Alice gets nothing, even though it was Alice who worked to solve the problem. A common way this occurs in practice is when a contract rewards people for calling out bad behavior in a protocol by giving a bad actor's deposit to the person who proved they were misbehaving.\\n\\nThe race condition that happens most frequently on the network today is the race condition in the ERC20 token standard. The ERC20 token standard includes a function called 'approve', which allows an address to approve another address to spend tokens on their behalf. Assume that Alice has approved Eve to spend n of her tokens, then Alice decides to change Eve's approval to m tokens. Alice submits a function call to approve with the value n for Eve. Eve runs an Ethereum node, so she knows that Alice is going to change her approval to m. Eve then submits a transferFrom request, sending n of Alice's tokens to herself, but gives it a much higher gas price than Alice's transaction. The transferFrom executes first so gives Eve n tokens and sets Eve's approval to zero. Then Alice's transaction executes and sets Eve's approval to m. Eve then sends those m tokens to herself as well. Thus, Eve gets n + m tokens, even though she should have gotten at most max(n,m).\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nA possible way to remedy race conditions in the submission of information in exchange for a reward is called a commit reveal hash scheme. Instead of submitting the answer, the party who has the answer submits hash(salt, address, answer) \\\\[salt being some number of their choosing\\\\]; the contract stores this hash and the sender's address. To claim the reward, the sender then submits a transaction with the salt, and answer. The contract hashes (salt, msg.sender, answer) and checks the hash produced against the stored hash. If the hash matches, the contract releases the reward.\\n\\nThe best fix for the ERC20 race condition is to add a field to the inputs of approve, which is the expected current value, and to have approve revert if Eve's current allowance is not what Alice indicated she was expecting. However, this means that your contract no longer conforms to the ERC20 standard. If it is important to your project to have the contract conform to ERC20, you can add a safe approve function. From the user's perspective, it is possible to mitigate the ERC20 race condition by setting approvals to zero before changing them.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n[General Article on Race Conditions](https://medium.com/coinmonks/solidity-transaction-ordering-attacks-1193a014884e)\\n[ERC20 Race Condition](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/edit#)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### ERC20.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\\n\\n/** Taken from the OpenZeppelin github\\n * @title SafeMath\\n * @dev Math operations with safety checks that revert on error\\n */\\nlibrary SafeMath {\\n\\n  /**\\n  * @dev Multiplies two numbers, reverts on overflow.\\n  */\\n  function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n    // Gas optimization: this is cheaper than requiring 'a' not being zero, but the\\n    // benefit is lost if 'b' is also tested.\\n    // See: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/522\\n    if (a == 0) {\\n      return 0;\\n    }\\n\\n    uint256 c = a * b;\\n    require(c / a == b);\\n\\n    return c;\\n  }\\n\\n  /**\\n  * @dev Integer division of two numbers truncating the quotient, reverts on division by zero.\\n  */\\n  function div(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n    require(b > 0);
