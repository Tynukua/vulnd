Currently, the solidity compiler will not return a warning for effect-free code. This can lead to the introduction of \\\"dead\\\" code that does not properly perform an intended action.\\n\\nFor example, it's easy to miss the trailing parentheses in `msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance)(\\\"\\\");`, which could lead to a function proceeding without transferring funds to `msg.sender`. Although, this should be avoided by [checking the return value of the call](./SWC-104.md).\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt's important to carefully ensure that your contract works as intended. Write  unit tests to verify correct behaviour of the code.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Issue on Solidity's Github - raise an error when a statement can never have side-effects](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2707)\\n- [Issue on Solidity's Github - msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance); should produce a warning](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7096)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### deposit_box.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract DepositBox {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Accept deposit\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'incorrect amount');\\n        // Should update user balance\\n        balance[msg.sender] == amount;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### deposit_box_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract DepositBox {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Accept deposit\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'incorrect amount');\\n        // Should update user balance\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### wallet.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract Wallet {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Deposit funds in contract\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'msg.value must be equal to amount');\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Withdraw funds from contract\\n    function withdraw(uint amount) public {\\n        require(amount <= balance[msg.sender], 'amount must be less than balance');\\n\\n        uint previousBalance = balance[msg.sender];\\n        balance[msg.sender] = previousBalance - amount;\\n\\n        // Attempt to send amount from the contract to msg.sender\\n        msg.sender.call.value(amount);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### wallet_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract Wallet {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Deposit funds in contract\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'msg.value must be equal to amount');\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Withdraw funds from contract\\n    function withdraw(uint amount) public {\\n        require(amount <= balance[msg.sender], 'amount must be less than balance');\\n\\n        uint previousBalance = balance[msg.sender];\\n        balance[msg.sender] = previousBalance - amount;\\n\\n        // Attempt to send amount from the contract to msg.sender\\n        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amount)(\\\"\\\");\\n        require(success, 'transfer failed');\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n# Please note, this content is no longer actively maintained.\\n\\nThe content of the SWC registry has not been thoroughly updated since 2020.

For instance if a number is stored in the uint8 type, it means that the number is stored in a 8 bits unsigned number ranging from 0 to 2^8-1. In computer programming, an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits â€“ either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt is recommended to use vetted safe math libraries for arithmetic operations consistently throughout the smart contract system.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices -

In the reentrancy attack (a.k.a. recursive call attack), a malicious contract calls back into the calling contract before the first invocation of the function is finished. This may cause the different invocations of the function to interact in undesirable ways.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nThe best practices to avoid Reentrancy weaknesses are:\\n\\n- Make sure all internal state changes are performed before the call is executed. This is known as the [Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security-considerations.html#use-the-checks-effects-interactions-pattern)\\n- Use a reentrancy lock (ie.

Currently, the solidity compiler will not return a warning for effect-free code. This can lead to the introduction of \\\"dead\\\" code that does not properly perform an intended action.\\n\\nFor example, it's easy to miss the trailing parentheses in `msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance)(\\\"\\\");`, which could lead to a function proceeding without transferring funds to `msg.sender`. Although, this should be avoided by [checking the return value of the call](./SWC-104.md).\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt's important to carefully ensure that your contract works as intended. Write  unit tests to verify correct behaviour of the code.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Issue on Solidity's Github - raise an error when a statement can never have side-effects](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2707)\\n- [Issue on Solidity's Github - msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance); should produce a warning](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7096)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### deposit_box.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract DepositBox {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Accept deposit\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'incorrect amount');\\n        // Should update user balance\\n        balance[msg.sender] == amount;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### deposit_box_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract DepositBox {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Accept deposit\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'incorrect amount');\\n        // Should update user balance\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### wallet.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract Wallet {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Deposit funds in contract\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'msg.value must be equal to amount');\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Withdraw funds from contract\\n    function withdraw(uint amount) public {\\n        require(amount <= balance[msg.sender], 'amount must be less than balance');\\n\\n        uint previousBalance = balance[msg.sender];\\n        balance[msg.sender] = previousBalance - amount;\\n\\n        // Attempt to send amount from the contract to msg.sender\\n        msg.sender.call.value(amount);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### wallet_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract Wallet {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Deposit funds in contract\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'msg.value must be equal to amount');\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Withdraw funds from contract\\n    function withdraw(uint amount) public {\\n        require(amount <= balance[msg.sender], 'amount must be less than balance');\\n\\n        uint previousBalance = balance[msg.sender];\\n        balance[msg.sender] = previousBalance - amount;\\n\\n        // Attempt to send amount from the contract to msg.sender\\n        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amount)(\\\"\\\");\\n        require(success, 'transfer failed');\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n# Please note, this content is no longer actively maintained.\\n\\nThe content of the SWC registry has not been thoroughly updated since 2020.

For instance if a number is stored in the uint8 type, it means that the number is stored in a 8 bits unsigned number ranging from 0 to 2^8-1. In computer programming, an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits â€“ either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt is recommended to use vetted safe math libraries for arithmetic operations consistently throughout the smart contract system.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices -

In the reentrancy attack (a.k.a. recursive call attack), a malicious contract calls back into the calling contract before the first invocation of the function is finished. This may cause the different invocations of the function to interact in undesirable ways.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nThe best practices to avoid Reentrancy weaknesses are:\\n\\n- Make sure all internal state changes are performed before the call is executed. This is known as the [Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security-considerations.html#use-the-checks-effects-interactions-pattern)\\n- Use a reentrancy lock (ie.  [OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol)).\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices - Reentrancy](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/attacks/reentrancy/)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### modifier_reentrancy.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract ModifierEntrancy {\\n\\n  mapping (address => uint) public tokenBalance;\\n  string constant name = \\\"Nu Token\\\";\\n  Bank bank;\\n\\n  constructor() public{\\n      bank = new Bank();\\n  }\\n\\n  //If a contract has a zero balance and supports the token give them some token\\n  function airDrop() hasNoBalance supportsToken  public{\\n    tokenBalance[msg.sender] += 20;\\n  }\\n\\n  //Checks that the contract responds the way we want\\n  modifier supportsToken() {\\n    require(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(\\\"Nu Token\\\")) == bank.supportsToken());\\n    _;\\n  }\\n\\n  //Checks that the caller has a zero balance\\n  modifier hasNoBalance {\\n      require(tokenBalance[msg.sender] == 0);\\n      _;\\n  }\\n}\\n\\ncontract Bank{\\n\\n    function supportsToken() external returns(bytes32) {\\n        return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(\\\"Nu Token\\\"));\\n    }\\n\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n### modifier_reentrancy_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract ModifierEntrancy {\\n  mapping (address => uint) public tokenBalance;\\n  string constant name = \\\"Nu Token\\\";\\n  Bank bank;\\n  constructor() public{\\n      bank = new Bank();\\n  }\\n\\n  //If a contract has a zero balance and supports the token give them some token\\n  function airDrop() supportsToken hasNoBalance  public{ // In the fixed version supportsToken comes before hasNoBalance\\n    tokenBalance[msg.sender] += 20;\\n  }\\n\\n  //Checks that the contract responds the way we want\\n  modifier supportsToken() {\\n    require(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(\\\"Nu Token\\\")) == bank.supportsToken());\\n    _;\\n  }\\n  //Checks that the caller has a zero balance\\n  modifier hasNoBalance {\\n      require(tokenBalance[msg.sender] == 0);\\n      _;\\n  }\\n}\\n\\ncontract Bank{\\n\\n    function supportsToken() external returns(bytes32){\\n        return(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(\\\"Nu Token\\\")));\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n### simple_dao.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @source: http://blockchain.unica.it/projects/ethereum-survey/attacks.html#simpledao\\n * @author: Atzei N., Bartoletti M., Cimoli T\\n * Modified by Josselin Feist\\n */\\npragma solidity 0.4.24;\\n\\ncontract SimpleDAO {\\n  mapping (address => uint) public credit;\\n\\n  function donate(address to) payable public{\\n    credit[to] += msg.value;\\n  }\\n\\n  function withdraw(uint amount) public{\\n    if (credit[msg.sender]>= amount) {\\n      require(msg.sender.call.value(amount)());\\n      credit[msg.sender]-=amount;\\n    }\\n  }  \\n\\n  function queryCredit(address to) view public returns(uint){\\n    return credit[to];\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n### simple_dao_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @source: http://blockchain.unica.it/projects/ethereum-survey/attacks.html#simpledao\\n * @author: Atzei N., Bartoletti M., Cimoli T\\n * Modified by Bernhard Mueller, Josselin Feist\\n */\\npragma solidity 0.4.24;\\n\\ncontract SimpleDAO {\\n  mapping (address => uint) public credit;\\n\\n  function donate(address to) payable public{\\n    credit[to] += msg.value;\\n  }\\n\\n  function withdraw(uint amount) public {\\n    if (credit[msg.sender]>= amount) {\\n      credit[msg.sender]-=amount;\\n      require(msg.sender.call.value(amount)());\\n    }\\n  }  \\n\\n  function queryCredit(address to) view public returns (uint){\\n    return credit[to];\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n- TARGET SOLIDITY CODE TO ANALYZE:\\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\\n\\ncontract PiggyBank{\\n    mapping(address => uint) public credit;\\n    \\n    function deposit() public payable {\\n        credit[msg.sender] += msg.value;\\n    }\\n\\n    function withdraw(uint amount) public{\\n        if (credit[msg.sender]>= amount) {\\n            require(payable(msg.sender).call{value: amount}(\\\"\\\"));\\n            credit[msg.sender]-=amount;\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\\nRETURN a COMPREHENSIVE JSON ARRAY where EACH DETECTED ISSUE follows THIS STRUCTURE:\\n[\\n  {\\n    \\\"line\\\": \\\"LINE NUMBER WHERE ISSUE OCCURS\\\",\\n    \\\"token\\\": \\\"EXACT PROBLEMATIC CODE SNIPPET\\\",\\n    \\\"problem\\\": \\\"CONCISE NAME OF THE ISSUE\\\",\\n    \\\"severity\\\": \\\"low | medium | high\\\",\\n    \\\"explanation\\\": \\\"DETAILED REASON WHY THIS IS A PROBLEM INCLUDING POTENTIAL IMPACT\\\",\\n    \\\"migration\\\": \\\"CLEAR AND ACTIONABLE INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO FIX OR MITIGATE THIS ISSUE\\\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n### CHAIN OF THOUGHTS TO APPLY ###\\nFOLLOW THIS STEP-BY-STEP LOGIC TO GUIDE YOUR ANALYSIS:\\n\\n1.

In the reentrancy attack (a.k.a. recursive call attack), a malicious contract calls back into the calling contract before the first invocation of the function is finished. This may cause the different invocations of the function to interact in undesirable ways.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nThe best practices to avoid Reentrancy weaknesses are:\\n\\n- Make sure all internal state changes are performed before the call is executed. This is known as the [Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security-considerations.html#use-the-checks-effects-interactions-pattern)\\n- Use a reentrancy lock (ie.  [OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol)).\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices - Reentrancy](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/attacks/reentrancy/)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### modifier_reentrancy.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract ModifierEntrancy {\\n\\n  mapping (address => uint) public tokenBalance;\\n  string constant name = \\\"Nu Token\\\";\\n  Bank bank;\\n\\n  constructor() public{\\n      bank = new Bank();\\n  }\\n\\n  //If a contract has a zero balance and supports the token give them some token\\n  function airDrop() hasNoBalance supportsToken  public{\\n    tokenBalance[msg.sender] += 20;\\n  }\\n\\n  //Checks that the contract responds the way we want\\n  modifier supportsToken() {\\n    require(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(\\\"Nu Token\\\")) == bank.supportsToken());\\n    _;\\n  }\\n\\n  //Checks that the caller has a zero balance\\n  modifier hasNoBalance {\\n      require(tokenBalance[msg.sender] == 0);\\n      _;\\n  }\\n}\\n\\ncontract Bank{\\n\\n    function supportsToken() external returns(bytes32) {\\n        return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(\\\"Nu Token\\\"));\\n    }\\n\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n### modifier_reentrancy_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract ModifierEntrancy {\\n  mapping (address => uint) public tokenBalance;\\n  string constant name = \\\"Nu Token\\\";\\n  Bank bank;\\n  constructor() public{\\n      bank = new Bank();\\n  }\\n\\n  //If a contract has a zero balance and supports the token give them some token\\n  function airDrop() supportsToken hasNoBalance  public{ // In the fixed version supportsToken comes before hasNoBalance\\n    tokenBalance[msg.sender] += 20;\\n  }\\n\\n  //Checks that the contract responds the way we want\\n  modifier supportsToken() {\\n    require(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(\\\"Nu Token\\\")) == bank.supportsToken());\\n    _;\\n  }\\n  //Checks that the caller has a zero balance\\n  modifier hasNoBalance {\\n      require(tokenBalance[msg.sender] == 0);\\n      _;\\n  }\\n}\\n\\ncontract Bank{\\n\\n    function supportsToken() external returns(bytes32){\\n        return(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(\\\"Nu Token\\\")));\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n### simple_dao.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @source: http://blockchain.unica.it/projects/ethereum-survey/attacks.html#simpledao\\n * @author: Atzei N., Bartoletti M., Cimoli T\\n * Modified by Josselin Feist\\n */\\npragma solidity 0.4.24;\\n\\ncontract SimpleDAO {\\n  mapping (address => uint) public credit;\\n\\n  function donate(address to) payable public{\\n    credit[to] += msg.value;\\n  }\\n\\n  function withdraw(uint amount) public{\\n    if (credit[msg.sender]>= amount) {\\n      require(msg.sender.call.value(amount)());\\n      credit[msg.sender]-=amount;\\n    }\\n  }  \\n\\n  function queryCredit(address to) view public returns(uint){\\n    return credit[to];\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n### simple_dao_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @source: http://blockchain.unica.it/projects/ethereum-survey/attacks.html#simpledao\\n * @author: Atzei N., Bartoletti M., Cimoli T\\n * Modified by Bernhard Mueller, Josselin Feist\\n */\\npragma solidity 0.4.24;\\n\\ncontract SimpleDAO {\\n  mapping (address => uint) public credit;\\n\\n  function donate(address to) payable public{\\n    credit[to] += msg.value;\\n  }\\n\\n  function withdraw(uint amount) public {\\n    if (credit[msg.sender]>= amount) {\\n      credit[msg.sender]-=amount;\\n      require(msg.sender.call.value(amount)());\\n    }\\n  }  \\n\\n  function queryCredit(address to) view public returns (uint){\\n    return credit[to];\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n# Please note, this content is no longer actively maintained.\\n\\nThe content of the SWC registry has not been thoroughly updated since 2020.

Currently, the solidity compiler will not return a warning for effect-free code. This can lead to the introduction of \\\"dead\\\" code that does not properly perform an intended action.\\n\\nFor example, it's easy to miss the trailing parentheses in `msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance)(\\\"\\\");`, which could lead to a function proceeding without transferring funds to `msg.sender`. Although, this should be avoided by [checking the return value of the call](./SWC-104.md).\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt's important to carefully ensure that your contract works as intended. Write  unit tests to verify correct behaviour of the code.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Issue on Solidity's Github - raise an error when a statement can never have side-effects](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2707)\\n- [Issue on Solidity's Github - msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance); should produce a warning](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7096)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### deposit_box.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract DepositBox {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Accept deposit\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'incorrect amount');\\n        // Should update user balance\\n        balance[msg.sender] == amount;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### deposit_box_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract DepositBox {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Accept deposit\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'incorrect amount');\\n        // Should update user balance\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### wallet.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract Wallet {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Deposit funds in contract\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'msg.value must be equal to amount');\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Withdraw funds from contract\\n    function withdraw(uint amount) public {\\n        require(amount <= balance[msg.sender], 'amount must be less than balance');\\n\\n        uint previousBalance = balance[msg.sender];\\n        balance[msg.sender] = previousBalance - amount;\\n\\n        // Attempt to send amount from the contract to msg.sender\\n        msg.sender.call.value(amount);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### wallet_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract Wallet {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Deposit funds in contract\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'msg.value must be equal to amount');\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Withdraw funds from contract\\n    function withdraw(uint amount) public {\\n        require(amount <= balance[msg.sender], 'amount must be less than balance');\\n\\n        uint previousBalance = balance[msg.sender];\\n        balance[msg.sender] = previousBalance - amount;\\n\\n        // Attempt to send amount from the contract to msg.sender\\n        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amount)(\\\"\\\");\\n        require(success, 'transfer failed');\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n# Please note, this content is no longer actively maintained.\\n\\nThe content of the SWC registry has not been thoroughly updated since 2020.

Historically, it has often been recommended to use these functions for value transfers to guard against reentrancy attacks. However, the gas cost of EVM instructions may change significantly during hard forks which may break already deployed contract systems that make fixed assumptions about gas costs.  For example. [EIP 1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884) broke several existing smart contracts due to a cost increase of the SLOAD instruction.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nAvoid the use of `transfer()` and `send()` and do not otherwise specify a fixed amount of gas when performing calls. Use `.call.value(...)(\\\"\\\")` instead. Use the checks-effects-interactions pattern and/or reentrancy locks to prevent reentrancy attacks.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [ChainSecurity - Ethereum Istanbul Hardfork: The Security Perspective](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IiRYSjwle02zQUmWId06Bss8GrxGyw6nQAiZdCRFEPk/)\\n- [Steve Marx - Stop Using Solidityâ€™s transfer() Now\\n  ](https://diligence.consensys.net/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/)\\n- [EIP 1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### hardcoded_gas_limits.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Bernhard Mueller (ConsenSys / MythX)\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity 0.6.4;\\n\\ninterface ICallable {\\n\\tfunction callMe() external;\\n}\\n\\ncontract HardcodedNotGood {\\n\\n    address payable _callable = 0xaAaAaAaaAaAaAaaAaAAAAAAAAaaaAaAaAaaAaaAa;\\n\\tICallable callable = ICallable(_callable);\\n\\n\\tconstructor() public payable {\\n\\t}\\n\\n    function doTransfer(uint256 amount) public {\\n        _callable.transfer(amount);\\n    }\\n\\n    function doSend(uint256 amount) public {\\n    \\t_callable.send(amount);\\n    }\\n\\n     function callLowLevel() public {\\n         _callable.call.value(0).gas(10000)(\\\"\\\");\\n     }\\n\\n     function callWithArgs() public {\\n         callable.callMe{gas: 10000}();\\n     }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\"\n",

Currently, the solidity compiler will not return a warning for effect-free code. This can lead to the introduction of \\\"dead\\\" code that does not properly perform an intended action.\\n\\nFor example, it's easy to miss the trailing parentheses in `msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance)(\\\"\\\");`, which could lead to a function proceeding without transferring funds to `msg.sender`. Although, this should be avoided by [checking the return value of the call](./SWC-104.md).\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt's important to carefully ensure that your contract works as intended. Write  unit tests to verify correct behaviour of the code.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Issue on Solidity's Github - raise an error when a statement can never have side-effects](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2707)\\n- [Issue on Solidity's Github - msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance); should produce a warning](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7096)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### deposit_box.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract DepositBox {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Accept deposit\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'incorrect amount');\\n        // Should update user balance\\n        balance[msg.sender] == amount;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### deposit_box_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract DepositBox {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Accept deposit\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'incorrect amount');\\n        // Should update user balance\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### wallet.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract Wallet {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Deposit funds in contract\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'msg.value must be equal to amount');\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Withdraw funds from contract\\n    function withdraw(uint amount) public {\\n        require(amount <= balance[msg.sender], 'amount must be less than balance');\\n\\n        uint previousBalance = balance[msg.sender];\\n        balance[msg.sender] = previousBalance - amount;\\n\\n        // Attempt to send amount from the contract to msg.sender\\n        msg.sender.call.value(amount);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### wallet_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract Wallet {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Deposit funds in contract\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'msg.value must be equal to amount');\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Withdraw funds from contract\\n    function withdraw(uint amount) public {\\n        require(amount <= balance[msg.sender], 'amount must be less than balance');\\n\\n        uint previousBalance = balance[msg.sender];\\n        balance[msg.sender] = previousBalance - amount;\\n\\n        // Attempt to send amount from the contract to msg.sender\\n        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amount)(\\\"\\\");\\n        require(success, 'transfer failed');\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n# Please note, this content is no longer actively maintained.\\n\\nThe content of the SWC registry has not been thoroughly updated since 2020.

Historically, it has often been recommended to use these functions for value transfers to guard against reentrancy attacks. However, the gas cost of EVM instructions may change significantly during hard forks which may break already deployed contract systems that make fixed assumptions about gas costs.  For example. [EIP 1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884) broke several existing smart contracts due to a cost increase of the SLOAD instruction.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nAvoid the use of `transfer()` and `send()` and do not otherwise specify a fixed amount of gas when performing calls. Use `.call.value(...)(\\\"\\\")` instead. Use the checks-effects-interactions pattern and/or reentrancy locks to prevent reentrancy attacks.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [ChainSecurity - Ethereum Istanbul Hardfork: The Security Perspective](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IiRYSjwle02zQUmWId06Bss8GrxGyw6nQAiZdCRFEPk/)\\n- [Steve Marx - Stop Using Solidityâ€™s transfer() Now\\n  ](https://diligence.consensys.net/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/)\\n- [EIP 1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### hardcoded_gas_limits.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Bernhard Mueller (ConsenSys / MythX)\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity 0.6.4;\\n\\ninterface ICallable {\\n\\tfunction callMe() external;\\n}\\n\\ncontract HardcodedNotGood {\\n\\n    address payable _callable = 0xaAaAaAaaAaAaAaaAaAAAAAAAAaaaAaAaAaaAaaAa;\\n\\tICallable callable = ICallable(_callable);\\n\\n\\tconstructor() public payable {\\n\\t}\\n\\n    function doTransfer(uint256 amount) public {\\n        _callable.transfer(amount);\\n    }\\n\\n    function doSend(uint256 amount) public {\\n    \\t_callable.send(amount);\\n    }\\n\\n     function callLowLevel() public {\\n         _callable.call.value(0).gas(10000)(\\\"\\\");\\n     }\\n\\n     function callWithArgs() public {\\n         callable.callMe{gas: 10000}();\\n     }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n- TARGET SOLIDITY CODE TO ANALYZE:\\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\\n\\ncontract PiggyBank is ReentrancyGuard {\\n    mapping(address => uint) public credit;\\n\\n    function deposit() public payable {\\n        credit[msg.sender] += msg.value;\\n    }\\n\\n    function withdraw(uint amount) public nonReentrant {\\n        require(credit[msg.sender] >= amount, \\\"Insufficient balance\\\");\\n        \\n        credit[msg.sender] -= amount; \\n        \\n        (bool success,) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: amount}(\\\"\\\");\\n        require(success, \\\"Transfer failed\\\");\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\\nRETURN a COMPREHENSIVE JSON ARRAY where EACH DETECTED ISSUE follows THIS STRUCTURE:\\n[\\n  {\\n    \\\"line\\\": \\\"LINE NUMBER WHERE ISSUE OCCURS\\\",\\n    \\\"token\\\": \\\"EXACT PROBLEMATIC CODE SNIPPET\\\",\\n    \\\"problem\\\": \\\"CONCISE NAME OF THE ISSUE\\\",\\n    \\\"severity\\\": \\\"low | medium | high\\\",\\n    \\\"explanation\\\": \\\"DETAILED REASON WHY THIS IS A PROBLEM INCLUDING POTENTIAL IMPACT\\\",\\n    \\\"migration\\\": \\\"CLEAR AND ACTIONABLE INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO FIX OR MITIGATE THIS ISSUE\\\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n### CHAIN OF THOUGHTS TO APPLY ###\\nFOLLOW THIS STEP-BY-STEP LOGIC TO GUIDE YOUR ANALYSIS:\\n\\n1.

For instance if a number is stored in the uint8 type, it means that the number is stored in a 8 bits unsigned number ranging from 0 to 2^8-1. In computer programming, an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits â€“ either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt is recommended to use vetted safe math libraries for arithmetic operations consistently throughout the smart contract system.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices -

Currently, the solidity compiler will not return a warning for effect-free code. This can lead to the introduction of \\\"dead\\\" code that does not properly perform an intended action.\\n\\nFor example, it's easy to miss the trailing parentheses in `msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance)(\\\"\\\");`, which could lead to a function proceeding without transferring funds to `msg.sender`. Although, this should be avoided by [checking the return value of the call](./SWC-104.md).\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt's important to carefully ensure that your contract works as intended.

For instance if a number is stored in the uint8 type, it means that the number is stored in a 8 bits unsigned number ranging from 0 to 2^8-1. In computer programming, an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits â€“ either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt is recommended to use vetted safe math libraries for arithmetic operations consistently throughout the smart contract system.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices -

Currently, the solidity compiler will not return a warning for effect-free code. This can lead to the introduction of \\\"dead\\\" code that does not properly perform an intended action.\\n\\nFor example, it's easy to miss the trailing parentheses in `msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance)(\\\"\\\");`, which could lead to a function proceeding without transferring funds to `msg.sender`. Although, this should be avoided by [checking the return value of the call](./SWC-104.md).\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt's important to carefully ensure that your contract works as intended.

This can\\nallow an attacker to corrupt the storage; for instance, by overwriting a field that stores\\nthe address of the contract owner.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nAs a general advice, given that all data structures share the same storage (address)\\nspace, one should make sure that writes to one data structure cannot inadvertently\\noverwrite entries of another data structure.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Entry to Underhanded Solidity Coding Contest 2017 (honorable mention)](https://github.com/Arachnid/uscc/tree/master/submissions-2017/doughoyte)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### arbitrary_location_write_simple.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.4.25;\\n\\ncontract Wallet {\\n    uint[] private bonusCodes;\\n    address private owner;\\n\\n    constructor() public {\\n        bonusCodes = new uint[](0);\\n        owner = msg.sender;\\n    }\\n\\n    function () public payable {\\n    }\\n\\n    function PushBonusCode(uint c) public {\\n        bonusCodes.push(c);\\n    }\\n\\n    function PopBonusCode() public {\\n        require(0 <= bonusCodes.length);\\n        bonusCodes.length--;\\n    }\\n\\n    function UpdateBonusCodeAt(uint idx, uint c) public {\\n        require(idx < bonusCodes.length);\\n        bonusCodes[idx] = c;\\n    }\\n\\n    function Destroy() public {\\n        require(msg.sender == owner);\\n        selfdestruct(msg.sender);\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n### arbitrary_location_write_simple_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.4.25;\\n\\ncontract Wallet {\\n    uint[] private bonusCodes;\\n    address private owner;\\n\\n    constructor() public {\\n        bonusCodes = new uint[](0);\\n        owner = msg.sender;\\n    }\\n\\n    function () public payable {\\n    }\\n\\n    function PushBonusCode(uint c) public {\\n        bonusCodes.push(c);\\n    }\\n\\n    function PopBonusCode() public {\\n        require(0 < bonusCodes.length);\\n        bonusCodes.length--;\\n    }\\n\\n    function UpdateBonusCodeAt(uint idx, uint c) public {\\n        require(idx < bonusCodes.length); //Since you now have to push very codes this is no longer an arbitray write.\\n        bonusCodes[idx] = c;\\n    }\\n\\n    function Destroy() public {\\n        require(msg.sender == owner);\\n        selfdestruct(msg.sender);\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n### mapping_write.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\\n\\n//This code is derived from the Capture the Ether https://capturetheether.com/challenges/math/mapping/\\n\\ncontract Map {\\n    address public owner;\\n    uint256[] map;\\n\\n    function set(uint256 key, uint256 value) public {\\n        if (map.length <= key) {\\n            map.length = key + 1;\\n        }\\n\\n        map[key] = value;\\n    }\\n\\n    function get(uint256 key) public view returns (uint256) {\\n        return map[key];\\n    }\\n    function withdraw() public{\\n      require(msg.sender == owner);\\n      msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n# Please note, this content is no longer actively maintained.\\n\\nThe content of the SWC registry has not been thoroughly updated since 2020.

For instance if a number is stored in the uint8 type, it means that the number is stored in a 8 bits unsigned number ranging from 0 to 2^8-1. In computer programming, an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits â€“ either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt is recommended to use vetted safe math libraries for arithmetic operations consistently throughout the smart contract system.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices -

Miners review the transactions they have received and select which ones to include in a block, based on who has paid a high enough gas price to be included. Additionally, when transactions are sent to the Ethereum network, they are forwarded to each node for processing. Thus, a person who is running an Ethereum node can tell which transactions are going to occur before they are finalized. A race condition vulnerability occurs when code depends on the order of the transactions submitted to it.\\n\\nThe simplest example of a race condition is when a smart contract gives a reward for submitting information. Suppose a contract will give out 1 token to the first person who solves a math problem. Alice solves the problem and submits the answer to the network with a standard gas price. Eve runs an Ethereum node and can see the answer to the math problem in the transaction that Alice submitted to the network. So, Eve submits the answer to the network with a much higher gas price, and thus it gets processed and committed before Alice's transaction. Eve receives one token, and Alice gets nothing, even though it was Alice who worked to solve the problem. A common way this occurs in practice is when a contract rewards people for calling out bad behavior in a protocol by giving a bad actor's deposit to the person who proved they were misbehaving.\\n\\nThe race condition that happens most frequently on the network today is the race condition in the ERC20 token standard. The ERC20 token standard includes a function called 'approve', which allows an address to approve another address to spend tokens on their behalf. Assume that Alice has approved Eve to spend n of her tokens, then Alice decides to change Eve's approval to m tokens. Alice submits a function call to approve with the value n for Eve. Eve runs an Ethereum node, so she knows that Alice is going to change her approval to m. Eve then submits a transferFrom request, sending n of Alice's tokens to herself, but gives it a much higher gas price than Alice's transaction. The transferFrom executes first so gives Eve n tokens and sets Eve's approval to zero. Then Alice's transaction executes and sets Eve's approval to m. Eve then sends those m tokens to herself as well. Thus, Eve gets n + m tokens, even though she should have gotten at most max(n,m).\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nA possible way to remedy race conditions in the submission of information in exchange for a reward is called a commit reveal hash scheme. Instead of submitting the answer, the party who has the answer submits hash(salt, address, answer) \\\\[salt being some number of their choosing\\\\]; the contract stores this hash and the sender's address. To claim the reward, the sender then submits a transaction with the salt, and answer. The contract hashes (salt, msg.sender, answer) and checks the hash produced against the stored hash. If the hash matches, the contract releases the reward.\\n\\nThe best fix for the ERC20 race condition is to add a field to the inputs of approve, which is the expected current value, and to have approve revert if Eve's current allowance is not what Alice indicated she was expecting. However, this means that your contract no longer conforms to the ERC20 standard. If it is important to your project to have the contract conform to ERC20, you can add a safe approve function. From the user's perspective, it is possible to mitigate the ERC20 race condition by setting approvals to zero before changing them.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n[General Article on Race Conditions](https://medium.com/coinmonks/solidity-transaction-ordering-attacks-1193a014884e)\\n[ERC20 Race Condition](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/edit#)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### ERC20.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\\n\\n/** Taken from the OpenZeppelin github\\n * @title SafeMath\\n * @dev Math operations with safety checks that revert on error\\n */\\nlibrary SafeMath {\\n\\n  /**\\n  * @dev Multiplies two numbers, reverts on overflow.\\n  */\\n  function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n    // Gas optimization: this is cheaper than requiring 'a' not being zero, but the\\n    // benefit is lost if 'b' is also tested.\\n    // See: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/522\\n    if (a == 0) {\\n      return 0;\\n    }\\n\\n    uint256 c = a * b;\\n    require(c / a == b);\\n\\n    return c;\\n  }\\n\\n  /**\\n  * @dev Integer division of two numbers truncating the quotient, reverts on division by zero.\\n  */\\n  function div(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n    require(b > 0);

Miners review the transactions they have received and select which ones to include in a block, based on who has paid a high enough gas price to be included. Additionally, when transactions are sent to the Ethereum network, they are forwarded to each node for processing. Thus, a person who is running an Ethereum node can tell which transactions are going to occur before they are finalized. A race condition vulnerability occurs when code depends on the order of the transactions submitted to it.\\n\\nThe simplest example of a race condition is when a smart contract gives a reward for submitting information. Suppose a contract will give out 1 token to the first person who solves a math problem. Alice solves the problem and submits the answer to the network with a standard gas price. Eve runs an Ethereum node and can see the answer to the math problem in the transaction that Alice submitted to the network. So, Eve submits the answer to the network with a much higher gas price, and thus it gets processed and committed before Alice's transaction. Eve receives one token, and Alice gets nothing, even though it was Alice who worked to solve the problem. A common way this occurs in practice is when a contract rewards people for calling out bad behavior in a protocol by giving a bad actor's deposit to the person who proved they were misbehaving.\\n\\nThe race condition that happens most frequently on the network today is the race condition in the ERC20 token standard. The ERC20 token standard includes a function called 'approve', which allows an address to approve another address to spend tokens on their behalf. Assume that Alice has approved Eve to spend n of her tokens, then Alice decides to change Eve's approval to m tokens. Alice submits a function call to approve with the value n for Eve. Eve runs an Ethereum node, so she knows that Alice is going to change her approval to m. Eve then submits a transferFrom request, sending n of Alice's tokens to herself, but gives it a much higher gas price than Alice's transaction. The transferFrom executes first so gives Eve n tokens and sets Eve's approval to zero. Then Alice's transaction executes and sets Eve's approval to m. Eve then sends those m tokens to herself as well. Thus, Eve gets n + m tokens, even though she should have gotten at most max(n,m).\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nA possible way to remedy race conditions in the submission of information in exchange for a reward is called a commit reveal hash scheme. Instead of submitting the answer, the party who has the answer submits hash(salt, address, answer) \\\\[salt being some number of their choosing\\\\]; the contract stores this hash and the sender's address. To claim the reward, the sender then submits a transaction with the salt, and answer. The contract hashes (salt, msg.sender, answer) and checks the hash produced against the stored hash. If the hash matches, the contract releases the reward.\\n\\nThe best fix for the ERC20 race condition is to add a field to the inputs of approve, which is the expected current value, and to have approve revert if Eve's current allowance is not what Alice indicated she was expecting. However, this means that your contract no longer conforms to the ERC20 standard. If it is important to your project to have the contract conform to ERC20, you can add a safe approve function. From the user's perspective, it is possible to mitigate the ERC20 race condition by setting approvals to zero before changing them.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n[General Article on Race Conditions](https://medium.com/coinmonks/solidity-transaction-ordering-attacks-1193a014884e)\\n[ERC20 Race Condition](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/edit#)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### ERC20.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\\n\\n/** Taken from the OpenZeppelin github\\n * @title SafeMath\\n * @dev Math operations with safety checks that revert on error\\n */\\nlibrary SafeMath {\\n\\n  /**\\n  * @dev Multiplies two numbers, reverts on overflow.\\n  */\\n  function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n    // Gas optimization: this is cheaper than requiring 'a' not being zero, but the\\n    // benefit is lost if 'b' is also tested.\\n    // See: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/522\\n    if (a == 0) {\\n      return 0;\\n    }\\n\\n    uint256 c = a * b;\\n    require(c / a == b);\\n\\n    return c;\\n  }\\n\\n  /**\\n  * @dev Integer division of two numbers truncating the quotient, reverts on division by zero.\\n  */\\n  function div(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n    require(b > 0);

Values such as `block.timestamp`, and `block.number` can give you a sense of the current time or a time delta, however, they are not safe to use for most purposes.\\n\\nIn the case of `block.timestamp`, developers often attempt to use it to trigger time-dependent events. As Ethereum is decentralized, nodes can synchronize time only to some degree. Moreover, malicious miners can alter the timestamp of their blocks, especially if they can gain advantages by doing so. However, miners can't set a timestamp smaller than the previous one (otherwise the block will be rejected), nor can they set the timestamp too far ahead in the future. Taking all of the above into consideration, developers can't rely on the preciseness of the provided timestamp.\\n\\nAs for `block.number`, considering the block time on Ethereum is generally about 14 seconds, it's possible to predict the time delta between blocks. However, block times are not constant and are subject to change for a variety of reasons, e.g. fork reorganisations and the difficulty bomb. Due to variable block times, `block.number` should also not be relied on for precise calculations of time.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nDevelopers should write smart contracts with the notion that block values are not precise, and the use of them can lead to unexpected effects. Alternatively, they may make use of oracles.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Safety: Timestamp dependence](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Safety#timestamp-dependence)\\n- [Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices - Timestamp Dependence](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/development-recommendations/solidity-specific/timestamp-dependence/)\\n- [How do Ethereum mining nodes maintain a time consistent with the network?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/5924/how-do-ethereum-mining-nodes-maintain-a-time-consistent-with-the-network/5926#5926)\\n- [Solidity: Timestamp dependency, is it possible to do safely?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/15047/solidity-timestamp-dependency-is-it-possible-to-do-safely)\\n- [Avoid using block.number as a timestamp](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/development-recommendations/solidity-specific/timestamp-dependence/#avoid-using-blocknumber-as-a-timestamp)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### time_lock.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract TimeLock {\\n    struct User {\\n        uint amount; // amount locked (in eth)\\n        uint unlockBlock; // minimum block to unlock eth\\n    }\\n\\n    mapping(address => User) private users;\\n\\n    // Tokens should be locked for exact time specified\\n    function lockEth(uint _time, uint _amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == _amount, 'must send exact amount');\\n        users[msg.sender].unlockBlock = block.number + (_time / 14);\\n        users[msg.sender].amount = _amount;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Withdraw tokens if lock period is over\\n    function withdraw() public {\\n        require(users[msg.sender].amount > 0, 'no amount locked');\\n        require(block.number >= users[msg.sender].unlockBlock, 'lock period not over');\\n\\n        uint amount = users[msg.sender].amount;\\n        users[msg.sender].amount = 0;\\n        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amount)(\\\"\\\");\\n        require(success, 'transfer failed');\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n### timed_crowdsale.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract TimedCrowdsale {\\n\\n  event Finished();\\n  event notFinished();\\n\\n  // Sale should finish exactly at January 1, 2019\\n  function isSaleFinished() private returns (bool) {\\n    return block.timestamp >= 1546300800;\\n  }\\n\\n  function run() public {\\n  \\tif (isSaleFinished()) {\\n  \\t\\temit Finished();\\n  \\t} else {\\n  \\t\\temit notFinished();\\n  \\t}\\n  }\\n\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n# Please note, this content is no longer actively maintained.\\n\\nThe content of the SWC registry has not been thoroughly updated since 2020.

Miners review the transactions they have received and select which ones to include in a block, based on who has paid a high enough gas price to be included. Additionally, when transactions are sent to the Ethereum network, they are forwarded to each node for processing. Thus, a person who is running an Ethereum node can tell which transactions are going to occur before they are finalized. A race condition vulnerability occurs when code depends on the order of the transactions submitted to it.\\n\\nThe simplest example of a race condition is when a smart contract gives a reward for submitting information. Suppose a contract will give out 1 token to the first person who solves a math problem. Alice solves the problem and submits the answer to the network with a standard gas price. Eve runs an Ethereum node and can see the answer to the math problem in the transaction that Alice submitted to the network. So, Eve submits the answer to the network with a much higher gas price, and thus it gets processed and committed before Alice's transaction. Eve receives one token, and Alice gets nothing, even though it was Alice who worked to solve the problem. A common way this occurs in practice is when a contract rewards people for calling out bad behavior in a protocol by giving a bad actor's deposit to the person who proved they were misbehaving.\\n\\nThe race condition that happens most frequently on the network today is the race condition in the ERC20 token standard. The ERC20 token standard includes a function called 'approve', which allows an address to approve another address to spend tokens on their behalf. Assume that Alice has approved Eve to spend n of her tokens, then Alice decides to change Eve's approval to m tokens. Alice submits a function call to approve with the value n for Eve. Eve runs an Ethereum node, so she knows that Alice is going to change her approval to m. Eve then submits a transferFrom request, sending n of Alice's tokens to herself, but gives it a much higher gas price than Alice's transaction. The transferFrom executes first so gives Eve n tokens and sets Eve's approval to zero. Then Alice's transaction executes and sets Eve's approval to m. Eve then sends those m tokens to herself as well. Thus, Eve gets n + m tokens, even though she should have gotten at most max(n,m).\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nA possible way to remedy race conditions in the submission of information in exchange for a reward is called a commit reveal hash scheme. Instead of submitting the answer, the party who has the answer submits hash(salt, address, answer) \\\\[salt being some number of their choosing\\\\]; the contract stores this hash and the sender's address. To claim the reward, the sender then submits a transaction with the salt, and answer. The contract hashes (salt, msg.sender, answer) and checks the hash produced against the stored hash. If the hash matches, the contract releases the reward.\\n\\nThe best fix for the ERC20 race condition is to add a field to the inputs of approve, which is the expected current value, and to have approve revert if Eve's current allowance is not what Alice indicated she was expecting. However, this means that your contract no longer conforms to the ERC20 standard. If it is important to your project to have the contract conform to ERC20, you can add a safe approve function. From the user's perspective, it is possible to mitigate the ERC20 race condition by setting approvals to zero before changing them.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n[General Article on Race Conditions](https://medium.com/coinmonks/solidity-transaction-ordering-attacks-1193a014884e)\\n[ERC20 Race Condition](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/edit#)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### ERC20.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\\n\\n/** Taken from the OpenZeppelin github\\n * @title SafeMath\\n * @dev Math operations with safety checks that revert on error\\n */\\nlibrary SafeMath {\\n\\n  /**\\n  * @dev Multiplies two numbers, reverts on overflow.\\n  */\\n  function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n    // Gas optimization: this is cheaper than requiring 'a' not being zero, but the\\n    // benefit is lost if 'b' is also tested.\\n    // See: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/522\\n    if (a == 0) {\\n      return 0;\\n    }\\n\\n    uint256 c = a * b;\\n    require(c / a == b);\\n\\n    return c;\\n  }\\n\\n  /**\\n  * @dev Integer division of two numbers truncating the quotient, reverts on division by zero.\\n  */\\n  function div(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n    require(b > 0);

For instance if a number is stored in the uint8 type, it means that the number is stored in a 8 bits unsigned number ranging from 0 to 2^8-1. In computer programming, an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits â€“ either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt is recommended to use vetted safe math libraries for arithmetic operations consistently throughout the smart contract system.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices -

Values such as `block.timestamp`, and `block.number` can give you a sense of the current time or a time delta, however, they are not safe to use for most purposes.\\n\\nIn the case of `block.timestamp`, developers often attempt to use it to trigger time-dependent events. As Ethereum is decentralized, nodes can synchronize time only to some degree. Moreover, malicious miners can alter the timestamp of their blocks, especially if they can gain advantages by doing so. However, miners can't set a timestamp smaller than the previous one (otherwise the block will be rejected), nor can they set the timestamp too far ahead in the future. Taking all of the above into consideration, developers can't rely on the preciseness of the provided timestamp.\\n\\nAs for `block.number`, considering the block time on Ethereum is generally about 14 seconds, it's possible to predict the time delta between blocks. However, block times are not constant and are subject to change for a variety of reasons, e.g. fork reorganisations and the difficulty bomb. Due to variable block times, `block.number` should also not be relied on for precise calculations of time.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nDevelopers should write smart contracts with the notion that block values are not precise, and the use of them can lead to unexpected effects. Alternatively, they may make use of oracles.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Safety: Timestamp dependence](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Safety#timestamp-dependence)\\n- [Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices - Timestamp Dependence](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/development-recommendations/solidity-specific/timestamp-dependence/)\\n- [How do Ethereum mining nodes maintain a time consistent with the network?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/5924/how-do-ethereum-mining-nodes-maintain-a-time-consistent-with-the-network/5926#5926)\\n- [Solidity: Timestamp dependency, is it possible to do safely?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/15047/solidity-timestamp-dependency-is-it-possible-to-do-safely)\\n- [Avoid using block.number as a timestamp](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/development-recommendations/solidity-specific/timestamp-dependence/#avoid-using-blocknumber-as-a-timestamp)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### time_lock.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract TimeLock {\\n    struct User {\\n        uint amount; // amount locked (in eth)\\n        uint unlockBlock; // minimum block to unlock eth\\n    }\\n\\n    mapping(address => User) private users;\\n\\n    // Tokens should be locked for exact time specified\\n    function lockEth(uint _time, uint _amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == _amount, 'must send exact amount');\\n        users[msg.sender].unlockBlock = block.number + (_time / 14);\\n        users[msg.sender].amount = _amount;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Withdraw tokens if lock period is over\\n    function withdraw() public {\\n        require(users[msg.sender].amount > 0, 'no amount locked');\\n        require(block.number >= users[msg.sender].unlockBlock, 'lock period not over');\\n\\n        uint amount = users[msg.sender].amount;\\n        users[msg.sender].amount = 0;\\n        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amount)(\\\"\\\");\\n        require(success, 'transfer failed');\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n### timed_crowdsale.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract TimedCrowdsale {\\n\\n  event Finished();\\n  event notFinished();\\n\\n  // Sale should finish exactly at January 1, 2019\\n  function isSaleFinished() private returns (bool) {\\n    return block.timestamp >= 1546300800;\\n  }\\n\\n  function run() public {\\n  \\tif (isSaleFinished()) {\\n  \\t\\temit Finished();\\n  \\t} else {\\n  \\t\\temit notFinished();\\n  \\t}\\n  }\\n\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n# Please note, this content is no longer actively maintained.\\n\\nThe content of the SWC registry has not been thoroughly updated since 2020.

Miners review the transactions they have received and select which ones to include in a block, based on who has paid a high enough gas price to be included. Additionally, when transactions are sent to the Ethereum network, they are forwarded to each node for processing. Thus, a person who is running an Ethereum node can tell which transactions are going to occur before they are finalized. A race condition vulnerability occurs when code depends on the order of the transactions submitted to it.\\n\\nThe simplest example of a race condition is when a smart contract gives a reward for submitting information. Suppose a contract will give out 1 token to the first person who solves a math problem. Alice solves the problem and submits the answer to the network with a standard gas price. Eve runs an Ethereum node and can see the answer to the math problem in the transaction that Alice submitted to the network. So, Eve submits the answer to the network with a much higher gas price, and thus it gets processed and committed before Alice's transaction. Eve receives one token, and Alice gets nothing, even though it was Alice who worked to solve the problem. A common way this occurs in practice is when a contract rewards people for calling out bad behavior in a protocol by giving a bad actor's deposit to the person who proved they were misbehaving.\\n\\nThe race condition that happens most frequently on the network today is the race condition in the ERC20 token standard. The ERC20 token standard includes a function called 'approve', which allows an address to approve another address to spend tokens on their behalf. Assume that Alice has approved Eve to spend n of her tokens, then Alice decides to change Eve's approval to m tokens. Alice submits a function call to approve with the value n for Eve. Eve runs an Ethereum node, so she knows that Alice is going to change her approval to m. Eve then submits a transferFrom request, sending n of Alice's tokens to herself, but gives it a much higher gas price than Alice's transaction. The transferFrom executes first so gives Eve n tokens and sets Eve's approval to zero. Then Alice's transaction executes and sets Eve's approval to m. Eve then sends those m tokens to herself as well. Thus, Eve gets n + m tokens, even though she should have gotten at most max(n,m).\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nA possible way to remedy race conditions in the submission of information in exchange for a reward is called a commit reveal hash scheme. Instead of submitting the answer, the party who has the answer submits hash(salt, address, answer) \\\\[salt being some number of their choosing\\\\]; the contract stores this hash and the sender's address. To claim the reward, the sender then submits a transaction with the salt, and answer. The contract hashes (salt, msg.sender, answer) and checks the hash produced against the stored hash. If the hash matches, the contract releases the reward.\\n\\nThe best fix for the ERC20 race condition is to add a field to the inputs of approve, which is the expected current value, and to have approve revert if Eve's current allowance is not what Alice indicated she was expecting. However, this means that your contract no longer conforms to the ERC20 standard. If it is important to your project to have the contract conform to ERC20, you can add a safe approve function.

Properly functioning code should *never* reach a failing assert statement. A reachable assertion can mean one of two things:\\n\\n1. A bug exists in the contract that allows it to enter an invalid state;\\n1. The `assert` statement is used incorrectly, e.g. to validate inputs.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nConsider whether the condition checked in the `assert()` is actually an invariant. If not, replace the `assert()` statement with a `require()` statement.\\n\\nIf the exception is indeed caused by unexpected behaviour of the code, fix the underlying bug(s) that allow the assertion to be violated.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [The use of revert(), assert(), and require() in Solidity, and the new REVERT opcode in the

For instance if a number is stored in the uint8 type, it means that the number is stored in a 8 bits unsigned number ranging from 0 to 2^8-1. In computer programming, an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits â€“ either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt is recommended to use vetted safe math libraries for arithmetic operations consistently throughout the smart contract system.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices -

For instance if a number is stored in the uint8 type, it means that the number is stored in a 8 bits unsigned number ranging from 0 to 2^8-1. In computer programming, an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits â€“ either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt is recommended to use vetted safe math libraries for arithmetic operations consistently throughout the smart contract system.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices -

Currently, the solidity compiler will not return a warning for effect-free code. This can lead to the introduction of \\\"dead\\\" code that does not properly perform an intended action.\\n\\nFor example, it's easy to miss the trailing parentheses in `msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance)(\\\"\\\");`, which could lead to a function proceeding without transferring funds to `msg.sender`. Although, this should be avoided by [checking the return value of the call](./SWC-104.md).\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt's important to carefully ensure that your contract works as intended.

In computer programming, an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits â€“ either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt is recommended to use vetted safe math libraries for arithmetic operations consistently throughout the smart contract system.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices -

In the reentrancy attack (a.k.a. recursive call attack), a malicious contract calls back into the calling contract before the first invocation of the function is finished. This may cause the different invocations of the function to interact in undesirable ways.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nThe best practices to avoid Reentrancy weaknesses are:\\n\\n- Make sure all internal state changes are performed before the call is executed. This is known as the [Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security-considerations.html#use-the-checks-effects-interactions-pattern)\\n- Use a reentrancy lock (ie.

In the reentrancy attack (a.k.a. recursive call attack), a malicious contract calls back into the calling contract before the first invocation of the function is finished. This may cause the different invocations of the function to interact in undesirable ways.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nThe best practices to avoid Reentrancy weaknesses are:\\n\\n- Make sure all internal state changes are performed before the call is executed. This is known as the [Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security-considerations.html#use-the-checks-effects-interactions-pattern)\\n- Use a reentrancy lock (ie.

Using the variable for authorization could make a contract vulnerable if an authorized account calls into a malicious contract.

Currently, the solidity compiler will not return a warning for effect-free code. This can lead to the introduction of \\\"dead\\\" code that does not properly perform an intended action.\\n\\nFor example, it's easy to miss the trailing parentheses in `msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance)(\\\"\\\");`, which could lead to a function proceeding without transferring funds to `msg.sender`. Although, this should be avoided by [checking the return value of the call](./SWC-104.md).\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt's important to carefully ensure that your contract works as intended. Write  unit tests to verify correct behaviour of the code.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Issue on Solidity's Github - raise an error when a statement can never have side-effects](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2707)\\n- [Issue on Solidity's Github - msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance); should produce a warning](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7096)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### deposit_box.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract DepositBox {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Accept deposit\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'incorrect amount');\\n        // Should update user balance\\n        balance[msg.sender] == amount;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### deposit_box_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract DepositBox {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Accept deposit\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'incorrect amount');\\n        // Should update user balance\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### wallet.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract Wallet {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Deposit funds in contract\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'msg.value must be equal to amount');\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Withdraw funds from contract\\n    function withdraw(uint amount) public {\\n        require(amount <= balance[msg.sender], 'amount must be less than balance');\\n\\n        uint previousBalance = balance[msg.sender];\\n        balance[msg.sender] = previousBalance - amount;\\n\\n        // Attempt to send amount from the contract to msg.sender\\n        msg.sender.call.value(amount);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### wallet_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract Wallet {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Deposit funds in contract\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'msg.value must be equal to amount');\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Withdraw funds from contract\\n    function withdraw(uint amount) public {\\n        require(amount <= balance[msg.sender], 'amount must be less than balance');\\n\\n        uint previousBalance = balance[msg.sender];\\n        balance[msg.sender] = previousBalance - amount;\\n\\n        // Attempt to send amount from the contract to msg.sender\\n        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amount)(\\\"\\\");\\n        require(success, 'transfer failed');\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n- TARGET SOLIDITY CODE TO ANALYZE:\\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\\n\\ncontract Secure {\\n    address owner;\\n\\n    constructor() {\\n        owner = msg.sender;\\n    }\\n\\n    function sensitiveAction() public {\\n        require(msg.sender == owner, \\\"Not authorized\\\");\\n        // safe now, uses msg.sender instead of tx.origin\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\\nRETURN a COMPREHENSIVE JSON ARRAY where EACH DETECTED ISSUE follows THIS STRUCTURE:\\n[\\n  {\\n    \\\"line\\\": \\\"LINE NUMBER WHERE ISSUE OCCURS\\\",\\n    \\\"token\\\": \\\"EXACT PROBLEMATIC CODE SNIPPET\\\",\\n    \\\"problem\\\": \\\"CONCISE NAME OF THE ISSUE\\\",\\n    \\\"severity\\\": \\\"low | medium | high\\\",\\n    \\\"explanation\\\": \\\"DETAILED REASON WHY THIS IS A PROBLEM INCLUDING POTENTIAL IMPACT\\\",\\n    \\\"migration\\\": \\\"CLEAR AND ACTIONABLE INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO FIX OR MITIGATE THIS ISSUE\\\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n### CHAIN OF THOUGHTS TO APPLY ###\\nFOLLOW THIS STEP-BY-STEP LOGIC TO GUIDE YOUR ANALYSIS:\\n\\n1.

This allows a smart contract to dynamically load code from a different address at runtime. Storage, current address and balance still refer to the calling contract.\\n\\nCalling into untrusted contracts is very dangerous, as the code at the target address can change any storage values of the caller and has full control over the caller's balance.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nUse `delegatecall` with caution and make sure to never call into untrusted contracts. If the target address is derived from user input ensure to check it against a whitelist of trusted contracts.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Solidity Documentation - Delegatecall / Callcode and Libraries](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#delegatecall-callcode-and-libraries)\\n- [How to Secure Your Smart Contracts: 6 Solidity Vulnerabilities and how to avoid them (Part 1) - Delegate Call](https://medium.com/loom-network/how-to-secure-your-smart-contracts-6-solidity-vulnerabilities-and-how-to-avoid-them-part-1-c33048d4d17d)\\n- [Solidity Security: Comprehensive list of known attack vectors and common anti-patterns - Delegatecall](https://blog.sigmaprime.io/solidity-security.html#delegatecall)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### proxy.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\\n\\ncontract Proxy {\\n\\n  address owner;\\n\\n  constructor() public {\\n    owner = msg.sender;  \\n  }\\n\\n  function forward(address callee, bytes _data) public {\\n    require(callee.delegatecall(_data));\\n  }\\n\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n### proxy_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\\n\\ncontract Proxy {\\n\\n  address callee;\\n  address owner;\\n\\n  modifier onlyOwner {\\n    require(msg.sender == owner);\\n    _;\\n  }\\n\\n  constructor() public {\\n  \\tcallee = address(0x0);\\n    owner = msg.sender;\\n  }\\n\\n  function setCallee(address newCallee) public onlyOwner {\\n  \\tcallee = newCallee;\\n  }\\n\\n  function forward(bytes _data) public {\\n    require(callee.delegatecall(_data));\\n  }\\n\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n### proxy_pattern_false_positive.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\\n\\ncontract proxy{\\n  address owner;\\n\\n  function proxyCall(address _to, bytes _data) external {\\n    require( !_to.delegatecall(_data));\\n  }\\n  function withdraw() external{\\n    require(msg.sender == owner);\\n    msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n/*\\nYou can't use proxyCall to change the owner address as either:\\n\\n1) the delegatecall reverts and thus does not change owner\\n2) the delegatecall does not revert and therefore will cause the proxyCall to revert and preventing owner from changing\\n\\nThis false positive may seem like a really edge case, however since you can revert data back to proxy this patern is useful for proxy architectures\\n*/\\n```\\n\\n\\n# Please note, this content is no longer actively maintained.\\n\\nThe content of the SWC registry has not been thoroughly updated since 2020.

Historically, it has often been recommended to use these functions for value transfers to guard against reentrancy attacks. However, the gas cost of EVM instructions may change significantly during hard forks which may break already deployed contract systems that make fixed assumptions about gas costs.  For example. [EIP 1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884) broke several existing smart contracts due to a cost increase of the SLOAD instruction.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nAvoid the use of `transfer()` and `send()` and do not otherwise specify a fixed amount of gas when performing calls. Use `.call.value(...)(\\\"\\\")` instead. Use the checks-effects-interactions pattern and/or reentrancy locks to prevent reentrancy attacks.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [ChainSecurity - Ethereum Istanbul Hardfork: The Security Perspective](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IiRYSjwle02zQUmWId06Bss8GrxGyw6nQAiZdCRFEPk/)\\n- [Steve Marx - Stop Using Solidityâ€™s transfer() Now\\n  ](https://diligence.consensys.net/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/)\\n- [EIP 1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### hardcoded_gas_limits.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Bernhard Mueller (ConsenSys / MythX)\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity 0.6.4;\\n\\ninterface ICallable {\\n\\tfunction callMe() external;\\n}\\n\\ncontract HardcodedNotGood {\\n\\n    address payable _callable = 0xaAaAaAaaAaAaAaaAaAAAAAAAAaaaAaAaAaaAaaAa;\\n\\tICallable callable = ICallable(_callable);\\n\\n\\tconstructor() public payable {\\n\\t}\\n\\n    function doTransfer(uint256 amount) public {\\n        _callable.transfer(amount);\\n    }\\n\\n    function doSend(uint256 amount) public {\\n    \\t_callable.send(amount);\\n    }\\n\\n     function callLowLevel() public {\\n         _callable.call.value(0).gas(10000)(\\\"\\\");\\n     }\\n\\n     function callWithArgs() public {\\n         callable.callMe{gas: 10000}();\\n     }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\"\n",

Storage, current address and balance still refer to the calling contract.\\n\\nCalling into untrusted contracts is very dangerous, as the code at the target address can change any storage values of the caller and has full control over the caller's balance.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nUse `delegatecall` with caution and make sure to never call into untrusted contracts. If the target address is derived from user input ensure to check it against a whitelist of trusted contracts.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Solidity Documentation - Delegatecall / Callcode and Libraries](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#delegatecall-callcode-and-libraries)\\n- [How to Secure Your Smart Contracts: 6 Solidity Vulnerabilities and how to avoid them (Part 1) - Delegate Call](https://medium.com/loom-network/how-to-secure-your-smart-contracts-6-solidity-vulnerabilities-and-how-to-avoid-them-part-1-c33048d4d17d)\\n- [Solidity Security: Comprehensive list of known attack vectors and common anti-patterns - Delegatecall](https://blog.sigmaprime.io/solidity-security.html#delegatecall)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### proxy.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\\n\\ncontract Proxy {\\n\\n  address owner;\\n\\n  constructor() public {\\n    owner = msg.sender;  \\n  }\\n\\n  function forward(address callee, bytes _data) public {\\n    require(callee.delegatecall(_data));\\n  }\\n\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n### proxy_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\\n\\ncontract Proxy {\\n\\n  address callee;\\n  address owner;\\n\\n  modifier onlyOwner {\\n    require(msg.sender == owner);\\n    _;\\n  }\\n\\n  constructor() public {\\n  \\tcallee = address(0x0);\\n    owner = msg.sender;\\n  }\\n\\n  function setCallee(address newCallee) public onlyOwner {\\n  \\tcallee = newCallee;\\n  }\\n\\n  function forward(bytes _data) public {\\n    require(callee.delegatecall(_data));\\n  }\\n\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n### proxy_pattern_false_positive.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\\n\\ncontract proxy{\\n  address owner;\\n\\n  function proxyCall(address _to, bytes _data) external {\\n    require( !_to.delegatecall(_data));\\n  }\\n  function withdraw() external{\\n    require(msg.sender == owner);\\n    msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n/*\\nYou can't use proxyCall to change the owner address as either:\\n\\n1) the delegatecall reverts and thus does not change owner\\n2) the delegatecall does not revert and therefore will cause the proxyCall to revert and preventing owner from changing\\n\\nThis false positive may seem like a really edge case, however since you can revert data back to proxy this patern is useful for proxy architectures\\n*/\\n```\\n\\n\\n# Please note, this content is no longer actively maintained.\\n\\nThe content of the SWC registry has not been thoroughly updated since 2020.

Historically, it has often been recommended to use these functions for value transfers to guard against reentrancy attacks. However, the gas cost of EVM instructions may change significantly during hard forks which may break already deployed contract systems that make fixed assumptions about gas costs.  For example. [EIP 1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884) broke several existing smart contracts due to a cost increase of the SLOAD instruction.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nAvoid the use of `transfer()` and `send()` and do not otherwise specify a fixed amount of gas when performing calls. Use `.call.value(...)(\\\"\\\")` instead. Use the checks-effects-interactions pattern and/or reentrancy locks to prevent reentrancy attacks.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [ChainSecurity - Ethereum Istanbul Hardfork: The Security Perspective](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IiRYSjwle02zQUmWId06Bss8GrxGyw6nQAiZdCRFEPk/)\\n- [Steve Marx - Stop Using Solidityâ€™s transfer() Now\\n  ](https://diligence.consensys.net/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/)\\n- [EIP 1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### hardcoded_gas_limits.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Bernhard Mueller (ConsenSys / MythX)\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity 0.6.4;\\n\\ninterface ICallable {\\n\\tfunction callMe() external;\\n}\\n\\ncontract HardcodedNotGood {\\n\\n    address payable _callable = 0xaAaAaAaaAaAaAaaAaAAAAAAAAaaaAaAaAaaAaaAa;\\n\\tICallable callable = ICallable(_callable);\\n\\n\\tconstructor() public payable {\\n\\t}\\n\\n    function doTransfer(uint256 amount) public {\\n        _callable.transfer(amount);\\n    }\\n\\n    function doSend(uint256 amount) public {\\n    \\t_callable.send(amount);\\n    }\\n\\n     function callLowLevel() public {\\n         _callable.call.value(0).gas(10000)(\\\"\\\");\\n     }\\n\\n     function callWithArgs() public {\\n         callable.callMe{gas: 10000}();\\n     }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n- TARGET SOLIDITY CODE TO ANALYZE:\\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\\n\\ncontract UncheckedCall {\\n    function withdraw(address _to) public {\\n        _to.call.value(1 ether)(); // unchecked call\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\\nRETURN a COMPREHENSIVE JSON ARRAY where EACH DETECTED ISSUE follows THIS STRUCTURE:\\n[\\n  {\\n    \\\"line\\\": \\\"LINE NUMBER WHERE ISSUE OCCURS\\\",\\n    \\\"token\\\": \\\"EXACT PROBLEMATIC CODE SNIPPET\\\",\\n    \\\"problem\\\": \\\"CONCISE NAME OF THE ISSUE\\\",\\n    \\\"severity\\\": \\\"low | medium | high\\\",\\n    \\\"explanation\\\": \\\"DETAILED REASON WHY THIS IS A PROBLEM INCLUDING POTENTIAL IMPACT\\\",\\n    \\\"migration\\\": \\\"CLEAR AND ACTIONABLE INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO FIX OR MITIGATE THIS ISSUE\\\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n### CHAIN OF THOUGHTS TO APPLY ###\\nFOLLOW THIS STEP-BY-STEP LOGIC TO GUIDE YOUR ANALYSIS:\\n\\n1.

Using the variable for authorization could make a contract vulnerable if an authorized account calls into a malicious contract. A call could be made to the vulnerable contract that passes the authorization check since `tx.origin` returns the original sender of the transaction which in this case is the authorized account.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\n`tx.origin` should not be used for authorization. Use `msg.sender` instead.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Solidity Documentation - tx.origin](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/security-considerations.html#tx-origin)\\n- [Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices - Avoid using tx.origin](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/development-recommendations/solidity-specific/tx-origin/)\\n- [SigmaPrime - Visibility](https://github.com/sigp/solidity-security-blog#tx-origin)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### mycontract.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @source: https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/recommendations/#avoid-using-txorigin\\n * @author: Consensys Diligence  \\n * Modified by Gerhard Wagner\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity 0.4.24;\\n\\ncontract MyContract {\\n\\n    address owner;\\n\\n    function MyContract() public {\\n        owner = msg.sender;\\n    }\\n\\n    function sendTo(address receiver, uint amount) public {\\n        require(tx.origin == owner);\\n        receiver.transfer(amount);\\n    }\\n\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### mycontract_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @source: https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/recommendations/#avoid-using-txorigin\\n * @author: Consensys Diligence\\n * Modified by Gerhard Wagner\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity 0.4.25;\\n\\ncontract MyContract {\\n\\n    address owner;\\n\\n    function MyContract() public {\\n        owner = msg.sender;\\n    }\\n\\n    function sendTo(address receiver, uint amount) public {\\n      require(msg.sender == owner);\\n      receiver.transfer(amount);\\n    }\\n\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n# Please note, this content is no longer actively maintained.\\n\\nThe content of the SWC registry has not been thoroughly updated since 2020.

Miners review the transactions they have received and select which ones to include in a block, based on who has paid a high enough gas price to be included. Additionally, when transactions are sent to the Ethereum network, they are forwarded to each node for processing. Thus, a person who is running an Ethereum node can tell which transactions are going to occur before they are finalized. A race condition vulnerability occurs when code depends on the order of the transactions submitted to it.\\n\\nThe simplest example of a race condition is when a smart contract gives a reward for submitting information. Suppose a contract will give out 1 token to the first person who solves a math problem. Alice solves the problem and submits the answer to the network with a standard gas price. Eve runs an Ethereum node and can see the answer to the math problem in the transaction that Alice submitted to the network. So, Eve submits the answer to the network with a much higher gas price, and thus it gets processed and committed before Alice's transaction. Eve receives one token, and Alice gets nothing, even though it was Alice who worked to solve the problem. A common way this occurs in practice is when a contract rewards people for calling out bad behavior in a protocol by giving a bad actor's deposit to the person who proved they were misbehaving.\\n\\nThe race condition that happens most frequently on the network today is the race condition in the ERC20 token standard. The ERC20 token standard includes a function called 'approve', which allows an address to approve another address to spend tokens on their behalf. Assume that Alice has approved Eve to spend n of her tokens, then Alice decides to change Eve's approval to m tokens. Alice submits a function call to approve with the value n for Eve. Eve runs an Ethereum node, so she knows that Alice is going to change her approval to m. Eve then submits a transferFrom request, sending n of Alice's tokens to herself, but gives it a much higher gas price than Alice's transaction. The transferFrom executes first so gives Eve n tokens and sets Eve's approval to zero. Then Alice's transaction executes and sets Eve's approval to m. Eve then sends those m tokens to herself as well. Thus, Eve gets n + m tokens, even though she should have gotten at most max(n,m).\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nA possible way to remedy race conditions in the submission of information in exchange for a reward is called a commit reveal hash scheme. Instead of submitting the answer, the party who has the answer submits hash(salt, address, answer) \\\\[salt being some number of their choosing\\\\]; the contract stores this hash and the sender's address. To claim the reward, the sender then submits a transaction with the salt, and answer. The contract hashes (salt, msg.sender, answer) and checks the hash produced against the stored hash. If the hash matches, the contract releases the reward.\\n\\nThe best fix for the ERC20 race condition is to add a field to the inputs of approve, which is the expected current value, and to have approve revert if Eve's current allowance is not what Alice indicated she was expecting. However, this means that your contract no longer conforms to the ERC20 standard. If it is important to your project to have the contract conform to ERC20, you can add a safe approve function. From the user's perspective, it is possible to mitigate the ERC20 race condition by setting approvals to zero before changing them.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n[General Article on Race Conditions](https://medium.com/coinmonks/solidity-transaction-ordering-attacks-1193a014884e)\\n[ERC20 Race Condition](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/edit#)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### ERC20.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\\n\\n/** Taken from the OpenZeppelin github\\n * @title SafeMath\\n * @dev Math operations with safety checks that revert on error\\n */\\nlibrary SafeMath {\\n\\n  /**\\n  * @dev Multiplies two numbers, reverts on overflow.\\n  */\\n  function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n    // Gas optimization: this is cheaper than requiring 'a' not being zero, but the\\n    // benefit is lost if 'b' is also tested.\\n    // See: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/522\\n    if (a == 0) {\\n      return 0;\\n    }\\n\\n    uint256 c = a * b;\\n    require(c / a == b);\\n\\n    return c;\\n  }\\n\\n  /**\\n  * @dev Integer division of two numbers truncating the quotient, reverts on division by zero.\\n  */\\n  function div(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n    require(b > 0);

Using the variable for authorization could make a contract vulnerable if an authorized account calls into a malicious contract. A call could be made to the vulnerable contract that passes the authorization check since `tx.origin` returns the original sender of the transaction which in this case is the authorized account.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\n`tx.origin` should not be used for authorization.

Miners review the transactions they have received and select which ones to include in a block, based on who has paid a high enough gas price to be included. Additionally, when transactions are sent to the Ethereum network, they are forwarded to each node for processing. Thus, a person who is running an Ethereum node can tell which transactions are going to occur before they are finalized. A race condition vulnerability occurs when code depends on the order of the transactions submitted to it.\\n\\nThe simplest example of a race condition is when a smart contract gives a reward for submitting information. Suppose a contract will give out 1 token to the first person who solves a math problem. Alice solves the problem and submits the answer to the network with a standard gas price. Eve runs an Ethereum node and can see the answer to the math problem in the transaction that Alice submitted to the network. So, Eve submits the answer to the network with a much higher gas price, and thus it gets processed and committed before Alice's transaction. Eve receives one token, and Alice gets nothing, even though it was Alice who worked to solve the problem. A common way this occurs in practice is when a contract rewards people for calling out bad behavior in a protocol by giving a bad actor's deposit to the person who proved they were misbehaving.\\n\\nThe race condition that happens most frequently on the network today is the race condition in the ERC20 token standard. The ERC20 token standard includes a function called 'approve', which allows an address to approve another address to spend tokens on their behalf. Assume that Alice has approved Eve to spend n of her tokens, then Alice decides to change Eve's approval to m tokens. Alice submits a function call to approve with the value n for Eve. Eve runs an Ethereum node, so she knows that Alice is going to change her approval to m. Eve then submits a transferFrom request, sending n of Alice's tokens to herself, but gives it a much higher gas price than Alice's transaction. The transferFrom executes first so gives Eve n tokens and sets Eve's approval to zero. Then Alice's transaction executes and sets Eve's approval to m. Eve then sends those m tokens to herself as well. Thus, Eve gets n + m tokens, even though she should have gotten at most max(n,m).\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nA possible way to remedy race conditions in the submission of information in exchange for a reward is called a commit reveal hash scheme. Instead of submitting the answer, the party who has the answer submits hash(salt, address, answer) \\\\[salt being some number of their choosing\\\\]; the contract stores this hash and the sender's address. To claim the reward, the sender then submits a transaction with the salt, and answer. The contract hashes (salt, msg.sender, answer) and checks the hash produced against the stored hash. If the hash matches, the contract releases the reward.\\n\\nThe best fix for the ERC20 race condition is to add a field to the inputs of approve, which is the expected current value, and to have approve revert if Eve's current allowance is not what Alice indicated she was expecting. However, this means that your contract no longer conforms to the ERC20 standard. If it is important to your project to have the contract conform to ERC20, you can add a safe approve function. From the user's perspective, it is possible to mitigate the ERC20 race condition by setting approvals to zero before changing them.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n[General Article on Race Conditions](https://medium.com/coinmonks/solidity-transaction-ordering-attacks-1193a014884e)\\n[ERC20 Race Condition](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/edit#)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### ERC20.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\\n\\n/** Taken from the OpenZeppelin github\\n * @title SafeMath\\n * @dev Math operations with safety checks that revert on error\\n */\\nlibrary SafeMath {\\n\\n  /**\\n  * @dev Multiplies two numbers, reverts on overflow.\\n  */\\n  function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n    // Gas optimization: this is cheaper than requiring 'a' not being zero, but the\\n    // benefit is lost if 'b' is also tested.\\n    // See: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/522\\n    if (a == 0) {\\n      return 0;\\n    }\\n\\n    uint256 c = a * b;\\n    require(c / a == b);\\n\\n    return c;\\n  }\\n\\n  /**\\n  * @dev Integer division of two numbers truncating the quotient, reverts on division by zero.\\n  */\\n  function div(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n    require(b > 0);

Since `abi.encodePacked()` packs all elements in order regardless of whether they're part of an array, you can move elements between arrays and, so long as all elements are in the same order, it will return the same encoding. In a signature verification situation, an attacker could exploit this by modifying the position of elements in a previous function call to effectively bypass authorization.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nWhen using `abi.encodePacked()`, it's crucial to ensure that a matching signature cannot be achieved using different parameters. To do so, either do not allow users access to parameters used in `abi.encodePacked()`, or use fixed length arrays. Alternatively, you can simply use `abi.encode()` instead.\\n\\nIt is also recommended that you use replay protection (see [SWC-121](./SWC-121.md)), although an attacker can still bypass this by [front-running](./SWC-114.md).\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Solidity Non-standard Packed Mode](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.3/abi-spec.html#non-standard-packed-mode)\\n- [Hash Collision Attack](https://learncryptography.com/hash-functions/hash-collision-attack)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### access_control.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Steve Marx\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\nimport \\\"./ECDSA.sol\\\";\\n\\ncontract AccessControl {\\n    using ECDSA for bytes32;\\n    mapping(address => bool) isAdmin;\\n    mapping(address => bool) isRegularUser;\\n    // Add admins and regular users.\\n    function addUsers(\\n        address[] calldata admins,\\n        address[] calldata regularUsers,\\n        bytes calldata signature\\n    )\\n        external\\n    {\\n        if (!isAdmin[msg.sender]) {\\n            // Allow calls to be relayed with an admin's signature.\\n            bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(admins, regularUsers));\\n            address signer = hash.toEthSignedMessageHash().recover(signature);\\n            require(isAdmin[signer], \\\"Only admins can add users.\\\");\\n        }\\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < admins.length; i++) {\\n            isAdmin[admins[i]] = true;\\n        }\\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < regularUsers.length; i++) {\\n            isRegularUser[regularUsers[i]] = true;\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### access_control_fixed_1.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Steve Marx\\n * Modified by Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\nimport \\\"./ECDSA.sol\\\";\\n\\ncontract AccessControl {\\n    using ECDSA for bytes32;\\n    mapping(address => bool) isAdmin;\\n    mapping(address => bool) isRegularUser;\\n    // Add a single user, either an admin or regular user.\\n    function addUser(\\n        address user,\\n        bool admin,\\n        bytes calldata signature\\n    )\\n        external\\n    {\\n        if (!isAdmin[msg.sender]) {\\n            // Allow calls to be relayed with an admin's signature.\\n            bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(user));\\n            address signer = hash.toEthSignedMessageHash().recover(signature);\\n            require(isAdmin[signer], \\\"Only admins can add users.\\\");\\n        }\\n        if (admin) {\\n            isAdmin[user] = true;\\n        } else {\\n            isRegularUser[user] = true;\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### access_control_fixed_2.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Steve Marx\\n * Modified by Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\nimport \\\"./ECDSA.sol\\\";\\n\\ncontract AccessControl {\\n    using ECDSA for bytes32;\\n    mapping(address => bool) isAdmin;\\n    mapping(address => bool) isRegularUser;\\n    // Add admins and regular users.\\n    function addUsers(\\n        // Use fixed length arrays.\\n        address[3] calldata admins,\\n        address[3] calldata regularUsers,\\n        bytes calldata signature\\n    )\\n        external\\n    {\\n        if (!isAdmin[msg.sender]) {\\n            // Allow calls to be relayed with an admin's signature.\\n            bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(admins, regularUsers));\\n            address signer = hash.toEthSignedMessageHash().recover(signature);\\n            require(isAdmin[signer], \\\"Only admins can add users.\\\");\\n        }\\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < admins.length; i++) {\\n            isAdmin[admins[i]] = true;\\n        }\\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < regularUsers.length; i++) {\\n            isRegularUser[regularUsers[i]] = true;\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n# Please note, this content is no longer actively maintained.\\n\\nThe content of the SWC registry has not been thoroughly updated since 2020.

The EVM specification defines several so-called â€˜precompiledâ€™ contracts one of them being `ecrecover` which executes the elliptic curve public key recovery. A malicious user can slightly modify the three values _v_, _r_ and _s_ to create other valid signatures. A system that performs signature verification on contract level might be susceptible to attacks if the signature is part of the signed message hash. Valid signatures could be created by a malicious user to replay previously signed messages.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nA signature should never be included into a signed message hash to check if previously messages have been processed by the contract.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n[Bitcoin Transaction Malleability](https://eklitzke.org/bitcoin-transaction-malleability)\\n[CTF - Challenge](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x0daabce0a1261b582e0d949ebca9dff4c22c88ef#code)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### transaction_malleablity.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\\n\\ncontract transaction_malleablity{\\n  mapping(address => uint256) balances;\\n  mapping(bytes32 => bool) signatureUsed;\\n\\n  constructor(address[] owners, uint[] init){\\n    require(owners.length == init.length);\\n    for(uint i=0;

Properly functioning code should *never* reach a failing assert statement. A reachable assertion can mean one of two things:\\n\\n1. A bug exists in the contract that allows it to enter an invalid state;\\n1. The `assert` statement is used incorrectly, e.g. to validate inputs.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nConsider whether the condition checked in the `assert()` is actually an invariant. If not, replace the `assert()` statement with a `require()` statement.\\n\\nIf the exception is indeed caused by unexpected behaviour of the code, fix the underlying bug(s) that allow the assertion to be violated.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [The use of revert(), assert(), and require() in Solidity, and the new REVERT opcode in the

Since `abi.encodePacked()` packs all elements in order regardless of whether they're part of an array, you can move elements between arrays and, so long as all elements are in the same order, it will return the same encoding. In a signature verification situation, an attacker could exploit this by modifying the position of elements in a previous function call to effectively bypass authorization.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nWhen using `abi.encodePacked()`, it's crucial to ensure that a matching signature cannot be achieved using different parameters. To do so, either do not allow users access to parameters used in `abi.encodePacked()`, or use fixed length arrays. Alternatively, you can simply use `abi.encode()` instead.\\n\\nIt is also recommended that you use replay protection (see [SWC-121](./SWC-121.md)), although an attacker can still bypass this by [front-running](./SWC-114.md).\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Solidity Non-standard Packed Mode](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.3/abi-spec.html#non-standard-packed-mode)\\n- [Hash Collision Attack](https://learncryptography.com/hash-functions/hash-collision-attack)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### access_control.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Steve Marx\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\nimport \\\"./ECDSA.sol\\\";\\n\\ncontract AccessControl {\\n    using ECDSA for bytes32;\\n    mapping(address => bool) isAdmin;\\n    mapping(address => bool) isRegularUser;\\n    // Add admins and regular users.\\n    function addUsers(\\n        address[] calldata admins,\\n        address[] calldata regularUsers,\\n        bytes calldata signature\\n    )\\n        external\\n    {\\n        if (!isAdmin[msg.sender]) {\\n            // Allow calls to be relayed with an admin's signature.\\n            bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(admins, regularUsers));\\n            address signer = hash.toEthSignedMessageHash().recover(signature);\\n            require(isAdmin[signer], \\\"Only admins can add users.\\\");\\n        }\\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < admins.length; i++) {\\n            isAdmin[admins[i]] = true;\\n        }\\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < regularUsers.length; i++) {\\n            isRegularUser[regularUsers[i]] = true;\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### access_control_fixed_1.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Steve Marx\\n * Modified by Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\nimport \\\"./ECDSA.sol\\\";\\n\\ncontract AccessControl {\\n    using ECDSA for bytes32;\\n    mapping(address => bool) isAdmin;\\n    mapping(address => bool) isRegularUser;\\n    // Add a single user, either an admin or regular user.\\n    function addUser(\\n        address user,\\n        bool admin,\\n        bytes calldata signature\\n    )\\n        external\\n    {\\n        if (!isAdmin[msg.sender]) {\\n            // Allow calls to be relayed with an admin's signature.\\n            bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(user));\\n            address signer = hash.toEthSignedMessageHash().recover(signature);\\n            require(isAdmin[signer], \\\"Only admins can add users.\\\");\\n        }\\n        if (admin) {\\n            isAdmin[user] = true;\\n        } else {\\n            isRegularUser[user] = true;\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### access_control_fixed_2.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Steve Marx\\n * Modified by Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\nimport \\\"./ECDSA.sol\\\";\\n\\ncontract AccessControl {\\n    using ECDSA for bytes32;\\n    mapping(address => bool) isAdmin;\\n    mapping(address => bool) isRegularUser;\\n    // Add admins and regular users.\\n    function addUsers(\\n        // Use fixed length arrays.\\n        address[3] calldata admins,\\n        address[3] calldata regularUsers,\\n        bytes calldata signature\\n    )\\n        external\\n    {\\n        if (!isAdmin[msg.sender]) {\\n            // Allow calls to be relayed with an admin's signature.\\n            bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(admins, regularUsers));\\n            address signer = hash.toEthSignedMessageHash().recover(signature);\\n            require(isAdmin[signer], \\\"Only admins can add users.\\\");\\n        }\\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < admins.length; i++) {\\n            isAdmin[admins[i]] = true;\\n        }\\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < regularUsers.length; i++) {\\n            isRegularUser[regularUsers[i]] = true;\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n# Please note, this content is no longer actively maintained.\\n\\nThe content of the SWC registry has not been thoroughly updated since 2020.

The EVM specification defines several so-called â€˜precompiledâ€™ contracts one of them being `ecrecover` which executes the elliptic curve public key recovery. A malicious user can slightly modify the three values _v_, _r_ and _s_ to create other valid signatures. A system that performs signature verification on contract level might be susceptible to attacks if the signature is part of the signed message hash. Valid signatures could be created by a malicious user to replay previously signed messages.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nA signature should never be included into a signed message hash to check if previously messages have been processed by the contract.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n[Bitcoin Transaction Malleability](https://eklitzke.org/bitcoin-transaction-malleability)\\n[CTF - Challenge](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x0daabce0a1261b582e0d949ebca9dff4c22c88ef#code)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### transaction_malleablity.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\\n\\ncontract transaction_malleablity{\\n  mapping(address => uint256) balances;\\n  mapping(bytes32 => bool) signatureUsed;\\n\\n  constructor(address[] owners, uint[] init){\\n    require(owners.length == init.length);\\n    for(uint i=0;

Although, this should be avoided by [checking the return value of the call](./SWC-104.md).\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt's important to carefully ensure that your contract works as intended. Write  unit tests to verify correct behaviour of the code.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Issue on Solidity's Github - raise an error when a statement can never have side-effects](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2707)\\n- [Issue on Solidity's Github - msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance); should produce a warning](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7096)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### deposit_box.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract DepositBox {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Accept deposit\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'incorrect amount');\\n        // Should update user balance\\n        balance[msg.sender] == amount;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### deposit_box_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract DepositBox {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Accept deposit\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'incorrect amount');\\n        // Should update user balance\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### wallet.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract Wallet {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Deposit funds in contract\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'msg.value must be equal to amount');\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Withdraw funds from contract\\n    function withdraw(uint amount) public {\\n        require(amount <= balance[msg.sender], 'amount must be less than balance');\\n\\n        uint previousBalance = balance[msg.sender];\\n        balance[msg.sender] = previousBalance - amount;\\n\\n        // Attempt to send amount from the contract to msg.sender\\n        msg.sender.call.value(amount);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### wallet_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract Wallet {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Deposit funds in contract\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'msg.value must be equal to amount');\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Withdraw funds from contract\\n    function withdraw(uint amount) public {\\n        require(amount <= balance[msg.sender], 'amount must be less than balance');\\n\\n        uint previousBalance = balance[msg.sender];\\n        balance[msg.sender] = previousBalance - amount;\\n\\n        // Attempt to send amount from the contract to msg.sender\\n        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amount)(\\\"\\\");\\n        require(success, 'transfer failed');\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\"\n",

Although, this should be avoided by [checking the return value of the call](./SWC-104.md).\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt's important to carefully ensure that your contract works as intended. Write  unit tests to verify correct behaviour of the code.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Issue on Solidity's Github - raise an error when a statement can never have side-effects](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2707)\\n- [Issue on Solidity's Github - msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance); should produce a warning](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7096)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### deposit_box.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract DepositBox {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Accept deposit\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'incorrect amount');\\n        // Should update user balance\\n        balance[msg.sender] == amount;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### deposit_box_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract DepositBox {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Accept deposit\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'incorrect amount');\\n        // Should update user balance\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### wallet.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract Wallet {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Deposit funds in contract\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'msg.value must be equal to amount');\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Withdraw funds from contract\\n    function withdraw(uint amount) public {\\n        require(amount <= balance[msg.sender], 'amount must be less than balance');\\n\\n        uint previousBalance = balance[msg.sender];\\n        balance[msg.sender] = previousBalance - amount;\\n\\n        // Attempt to send amount from the contract to msg.sender\\n        msg.sender.call.value(amount);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### wallet_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract Wallet {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Deposit funds in contract\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'msg.value must be equal to amount');\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Withdraw funds from contract\\n    function withdraw(uint amount) public {\\n        require(amount <= balance[msg.sender], 'amount must be less than balance');\\n\\n        uint previousBalance = balance[msg.sender];\\n        balance[msg.sender] = previousBalance - amount;\\n\\n        // Attempt to send amount from the contract to msg.sender\\n        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amount)(\\\"\\\");\\n        require(success, 'transfer failed');\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n- TARGET SOLIDITY CODE TO ANALYZE:\\npragma solidity ^0.6.0;\\n\\ncontract SelfDestruct {\\n    function destroy() public {\\n        selfdestruct(msg.sender); // unprotected\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\\nRETURN a COMPREHENSIVE JSON ARRAY where EACH DETECTED ISSUE follows THIS STRUCTURE:\\n[\\n  {\\n    \\\"line\\\": \\\"LINE NUMBER WHERE ISSUE OCCURS\\\",\\n    \\\"token\\\": \\\"EXACT PROBLEMATIC CODE SNIPPET\\\",\\n    \\\"problem\\\": \\\"CONCISE NAME OF THE ISSUE\\\",\\n    \\\"severity\\\": \\\"low | medium | high\\\",\\n    \\\"explanation\\\": \\\"DETAILED REASON WHY THIS IS A PROBLEM INCLUDING POTENTIAL IMPACT\\\",\\n    \\\"migration\\\": \\\"CLEAR AND ACTIONABLE INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO FIX OR MITIGATE THIS ISSUE\\\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n### CHAIN OF THOUGHTS TO APPLY ###\\nFOLLOW THIS STEP-BY-STEP LOGIC TO GUIDE YOUR ANALYSIS:\\n\\n1.

For example, `sha3` can be replaced with `keccak256`.\\n\\n| Deprecated              | Alternative             |\\n| ----------------------- | ----------------------- |\\n| `suicide(address)`      | `selfdestruct(address)` |\\n| `block.blockhash(uint)` | `blockhash(uint)`       |\\n| `sha3(...)`             | `keccak256(...)`        |\\n| `callcode(...)`         | `delegatecall(...)`     |\\n| `throw`                 | `revert()`              |\\n| `msg.gas`               | `gasleft`               |\\n| `constant`              | `view`                  |\\n| `var`                   | corresponding type name |\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [List of global variables and functions, as of Solidity 0.4.25](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.25/miscellaneous.html#global-variables)\\n- [Error handling: Assert, Require, Revert and Exceptions](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.25/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions)\\n- [View functions](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.25/contracts.html#view-functions)\\n- [Untyped declaration is deprecated as of Solidity 0.4.20](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.4.20)\\n- [Solidity compiler changelog](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### deprecated_simple.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\\n\\ncontract DeprecatedSimple {\\n\\n    // Do everything that's deprecated, then commit suicide.\\n\\n    function useDeprecated() public constant {\\n\\n        bytes32 blockhash = block.blockhash(0);\\n        bytes32 hashofhash = sha3(blockhash);\\n\\n        uint gas = msg.gas;\\n\\n        if (gas == 0) {\\n            throw;\\n        }\\n\\n        address(this).callcode();\\n\\n        var a = [1,2,3];\\n\\n        var (x, y, z) = (false, \\\"test\\\", 0);\\n\\n        suicide(address(0));\\n    }\\n\\n    function () public {}\\n\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n### deprecated_simple_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\\n\\ncontract DeprecatedSimpleFixed {\\n\\n    function useDeprecatedFixed() public view {\\n\\n        bytes32 bhash = blockhash(0);\\n        bytes32 hashofhash = keccak256(bhash);\\n\\n        uint gas = gasleft();\\n\\n        if (gas == 0) {\\n            revert();\\n        }\\n\\n        address(this).delegatecall();\\n\\n        uint8[3] memory a = [1,2,3];\\n\\n        (bool x, string memory y, uint8 z) = (false, \\\"test\\\", 0);\\n\\n        selfdestruct(address(0));\\n    }\\n\\n    function () external {}\\n\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n# Please note, this content is no longer actively maintained.\\n\\nThe content of the SWC registry has not been thoroughly updated since 2020.

Historically, it has often been recommended to use these functions for value transfers to guard against reentrancy attacks. However, the gas cost of EVM instructions may change significantly during hard forks which may break already deployed contract systems that make fixed assumptions about gas costs.  For example. [EIP 1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884) broke several existing smart contracts due to a cost increase of the SLOAD instruction.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nAvoid the use of `transfer()` and `send()` and do not otherwise specify a fixed amount of gas when performing calls. Use `.call.value(...)(\\\"\\\")` instead. Use the checks-effects-interactions pattern and/or reentrancy locks to prevent reentrancy attacks.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [ChainSecurity - Ethereum Istanbul Hardfork: The Security Perspective](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IiRYSjwle02zQUmWId06Bss8GrxGyw6nQAiZdCRFEPk/)\\n- [Steve Marx - Stop Using Solidityâ€™s transfer() Now\\n  ](https://diligence.consensys.net/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/)\\n- [EIP 1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### hardcoded_gas_limits.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Bernhard Mueller (ConsenSys / MythX)\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity 0.6.4;\\n\\ninterface ICallable {\\n\\tfunction callMe() external;\\n}\\n\\ncontract HardcodedNotGood {\\n\\n    address payable _callable = 0xaAaAaAaaAaAaAaaAaAAAAAAAAaaaAaAaAaaAaaAa;\\n\\tICallable callable = ICallable(_callable);\\n\\n\\tconstructor() public payable {\\n\\t}\\n\\n    function doTransfer(uint256 amount) public {\\n        _callable.transfer(amount);\\n    }\\n\\n    function doSend(uint256 amount) public {\\n    \\t_callable.send(amount);\\n    }\\n\\n     function callLowLevel() public {\\n         _callable.call.value(0).gas(10000)(\\\"\\\");\\n     }\\n\\n     function callWithArgs() public {\\n         callable.callMe{gas: 10000}();\\n     }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\"\n",

Historically, it has often been recommended to use these functions for value transfers to guard against reentrancy attacks. However, the gas cost of EVM instructions may change significantly during hard forks which may break already deployed contract systems that make fixed assumptions about gas costs.  For example. [EIP 1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884) broke several existing smart contracts due to a cost increase of the SLOAD instruction.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nAvoid the use of `transfer()` and `send()` and do not otherwise specify a fixed amount of gas when performing calls. Use `.call.value(...)(\\\"\\\")` instead. Use the checks-effects-interactions pattern and/or reentrancy locks to prevent reentrancy attacks.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [ChainSecurity - Ethereum Istanbul Hardfork: The Security Perspective](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IiRYSjwle02zQUmWId06Bss8GrxGyw6nQAiZdCRFEPk/)\\n- [Steve Marx - Stop Using Solidityâ€™s transfer() Now\\n  ](https://diligence.consensys.net/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/)\\n- [EIP 1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### hardcoded_gas_limits.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Bernhard Mueller (ConsenSys / MythX)\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity 0.6.4;\\n\\ninterface ICallable {\\n\\tfunction callMe() external;\\n}\\n\\ncontract HardcodedNotGood {\\n\\n    address payable _callable = 0xaAaAaAaaAaAaAaaAaAAAAAAAAaaaAaAaAaaAaaAa;\\n\\tICallable callable = ICallable(_callable);\\n\\n\\tconstructor() public payable {\\n\\t}\\n\\n    function doTransfer(uint256 amount) public {\\n        _callable.transfer(amount);\\n    }\\n\\n    function doSend(uint256 amount) public {\\n    \\t_callable.send(amount);\\n    }\\n\\n     function callLowLevel() public {\\n         _callable.call.value(0).gas(10000)(\\\"\\\");\\n     }\\n\\n     function callWithArgs() public {\\n         callable.callMe{gas: 10000}();\\n     }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n- TARGET SOLIDITY CODE TO ANALYZE:\\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\\n\\ncontract DeprecatedFunctions {\\n    function example() public {\\n        sha3(\\\"data\\\"); // deprecated\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\\nRETURN a COMPREHENSIVE JSON ARRAY where EACH DETECTED ISSUE follows THIS STRUCTURE:\\n[\\n  {\\n    \\\"line\\\": \\\"LINE NUMBER WHERE ISSUE OCCURS\\\",\\n    \\\"token\\\": \\\"EXACT PROBLEMATIC CODE SNIPPET\\\",\\n    \\\"problem\\\": \\\"CONCISE NAME OF THE ISSUE\\\",\\n    \\\"severity\\\": \\\"low | medium | high\\\",\\n    \\\"explanation\\\": \\\"DETAILED REASON WHY THIS IS A PROBLEM INCLUDING POTENTIAL IMPACT\\\",\\n    \\\"migration\\\": \\\"CLEAR AND ACTIONABLE INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO FIX OR MITIGATE THIS ISSUE\\\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n### CHAIN OF THOUGHTS TO APPLY ###\\nFOLLOW THIS STEP-BY-STEP LOGIC TO GUIDE YOUR ANALYSIS:\\n\\n1.

Currently, the solidity compiler will not return a warning for effect-free code. This can lead to the introduction of \\\"dead\\\" code that does not properly perform an intended action.\\n\\nFor example, it's easy to miss the trailing parentheses in `msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance)(\\\"\\\");`, which could lead to a function proceeding without transferring funds to `msg.sender`. Although, this should be avoided by [checking the return value of the call](./SWC-104.md).\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt's important to carefully ensure that your contract works as intended.

For instance if a number is stored in the uint8 type, it means that the number is stored in a 8 bits unsigned number ranging from 0 to 2^8-1. In computer programming, an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits â€“ either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt is recommended to use vetted safe math libraries for arithmetic operations consistently throughout the smart contract system.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices -

Currently, the solidity compiler will not return a warning for effect-free code. This can lead to the introduction of \\\"dead\\\" code that does not properly perform an intended action.\\n\\nFor example, it's easy to miss the trailing parentheses in `msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance)(\\\"\\\");`, which could lead to a function proceeding without transferring funds to `msg.sender`. Although, this should be avoided by [checking the return value of the call](./SWC-104.md).\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt's important to carefully ensure that your contract works as intended.

Multiple inheritance introduces ambiguity called [Diamond Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance#The_diamond_problem): if two or more base contracts define the same function, which one should be called in the child contract? Solidity deals with this ambiguity by using reverse [C3 Linearization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization), which sets a priority between base contracts.\\n\\nThat way, base contracts have different priorities, so the order of inheritance matters. Neglecting inheritance order can lead to unexpected behavior.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nWhen inheriting multiple contracts, especially if they have identical functions, a developer should carefully specify inheritance in the correct order. The rule of thumb is to inherit contracts from more /general/ to more /specific/.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Smart Contract Best Practices - Complex Inheritance](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/development-recommendations/solidity-specific/complex-inheritance/)\\n- [Solidity docs - Multiple Inheritance and Linearization](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.25/contracts.html#multiple-inheritance-and-linearization)\\n- [Solidity anti-patterns: Fun with inheritance DAG abuse](https://pdaian.com/blog/solidity-anti-patterns-fun-with-inheritance-dag-abuse)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### MDTCrowdsale.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @source: https://github.com/Arachnid/uscc/blob/master/submissions-2017/philipdaian/MDTCrowdsale.sol\\n * @author: Philip Daian\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.4.25;\\n\\n//import \\\"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol\\\";\\n/**\\n * @title SafeMath\\n * @dev Math operations with safety checks that revert on error\\n */\\nlibrary SafeMath {\\n    /**\\n    * @dev Multiplies two numbers, reverts on overflow.\\n    */\\n    function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n        // Gas optimization: this is cheaper than requiring 'a' not being zero, but the\\n        // benefit is lost if 'b' is also tested.\\n        // See: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/522\\n        if (a == 0) {\\n            return 0;\\n        }\\n\\n        uint256 c = a * b;\\n        require(c / a == b);\\n\\n        return c;\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n    * @dev Integer division of two numbers truncating the quotient, reverts on division by zero.\\n    */\\n    function div(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n        // Solidity only automatically asserts when dividing by 0\\n        require(b > 0);\\n        uint256 c = a / b;\\n        // assert(a == b * c + a % b); // There is no case in which this doesn't hold\\n\\n        return c;\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n    * @dev Subtracts two numbers, reverts on overflow (i.e. if subtrahend is greater than minuend).\\n    */\\n    function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n        require(b <= a);\\n        uint256 c = a - b;\\n\\n        return c;\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n    * @dev Adds two numbers, reverts on overflow.\\n    */\\n    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n        uint256 c = a + b;\\n        require(c >= a);\\n\\n        return c;\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n    * @dev Divides two numbers and returns the remainder (unsigned integer modulo),\\n    * reverts when dividing by zero.\\n    */\\n    function mod(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n        require(b != 0);\\n        return a % b;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n//import \\\"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20Mintable.sol\\\";\\n\\n/**\\n * @title ERC20 interface\\n * @dev see https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20\\n */\\ninterface IERC20 {\\n    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);\\n\\n    function balanceOf(address who) external view returns (uint256);\\n\\n    function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256);\\n\\n    function transfer(address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool);\\n\\n    function approve(address spender, uint256 value) external returns (bool);\\n\\n    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool);\\n\\n    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);\\n\\n    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);\\n}\\n\\n/**\\n * @title Standard ERC20 token\\n *\\n * @dev Implementation of the basic standard token.\\n * https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md\\n * Originally based on code by FirstBlood: https://github.com/Firstbloodio/token/blob/master/smart_contract/FirstBloodToken.sol\\n *\\n * This implementation emits additional Approval events, allowing applications to reconstruct the allowance status for\\n * all accounts just by listening to said events.

For instance if a number is stored in the uint8 type, it means that the number is stored in a 8 bits unsigned number ranging from 0 to 2^8-1. In computer programming, an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits â€“ either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt is recommended to use vetted safe math libraries for arithmetic operations consistently throughout the smart contract system.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices -

Properly functioning code should *never* reach a failing assert statement. A reachable assertion can mean one of two things:\\n\\n1. A bug exists in the contract that allows it to enter an invalid state;\\n1. The `assert` statement is used incorrectly, e.g. to validate inputs.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nConsider whether the condition checked in the `assert()` is actually an invariant. If not, replace the `assert()` statement with a `require()` statement.\\n\\nIf the exception is indeed caused by unexpected behaviour of the code, fix the underlying bug(s) that allow the assertion to be violated.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [The use of revert(), assert(), and require() in Solidity, and the new REVERT opcode in the

Currently, the solidity compiler will not return a warning for effect-free code.

Although, this should be avoided by [checking the return value of the call](./SWC-104.md).\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt's important to carefully ensure that your contract works as intended.

Multiple inheritance introduces ambiguity called [Diamond Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance#The_diamond_problem): if two or more base contracts define the same function, which one should be called in the child contract? Solidity deals with this ambiguity by using reverse [C3 Linearization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization), which sets a priority between base contracts.\\n\\nThat way, base contracts have different priorities, so the order of inheritance matters. Neglecting inheritance order can lead to unexpected behavior.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nWhen inheriting multiple contracts, especially if they have identical functions, a developer should carefully specify inheritance in the correct order.

Historically, it has often been recommended to use these functions for value transfers to guard against reentrancy attacks. However, the gas cost of EVM instructions may change significantly during hard forks which may break already deployed contract systems that make fixed assumptions about gas costs.  For example. [EIP 1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884) broke several existing smart contracts due to a cost increase of the SLOAD instruction.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nAvoid the use of `transfer()` and `send()` and do not otherwise specify a fixed amount of gas when performing calls. Use `.call.value(...)(\\\"\\\")` instead. Use the checks-effects-interactions pattern and/or reentrancy locks to prevent reentrancy attacks.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [ChainSecurity - Ethereum Istanbul Hardfork: The Security Perspective](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IiRYSjwle02zQUmWId06Bss8GrxGyw6nQAiZdCRFEPk/)\\n- [Steve Marx - Stop Using Solidityâ€™s transfer() Now\\n  ](https://diligence.consensys.net/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/)\\n- [EIP 1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### hardcoded_gas_limits.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Bernhard Mueller (ConsenSys / MythX)\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity 0.6.4;\\n\\ninterface ICallable {\\n\\tfunction callMe() external;\\n}\\n\\ncontract HardcodedNotGood {\\n\\n    address payable _callable = 0xaAaAaAaaAaAaAaaAaAAAAAAAAaaaAaAaAaaAaaAa;\\n\\tICallable callable = ICallable(_callable);\\n\\n\\tconstructor() public payable {\\n\\t}\\n\\n    function doTransfer(uint256 amount) public {\\n        _callable.transfer(amount);\\n    }\\n\\n    function doSend(uint256 amount) public {\\n    \\t_callable.send(amount);\\n    }\\n\\n     function callLowLevel() public {\\n         _callable.call.value(0).gas(10000)(\\\"\\\");\\n     }\\n\\n     function callWithArgs() public {\\n         callable.callMe{gas: 10000}();\\n     }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n# Please note, this content is no longer actively maintained.\\n\\nThe content of the SWC registry has not been thoroughly updated since 2020.

Historically, it has often been recommended to use these functions for value transfers to guard against reentrancy attacks. However, the gas cost of EVM instructions may change significantly during hard forks which may break already deployed contract systems that make fixed assumptions about gas costs.  For example. [EIP 1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884) broke several existing smart contracts due to a cost increase of the SLOAD instruction.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nAvoid the use of `transfer()` and `send()` and do not otherwise specify a fixed amount of gas when performing calls. Use `.call.value(...)(\\\"\\\")` instead. Use the checks-effects-interactions pattern and/or reentrancy locks to prevent reentrancy attacks.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [ChainSecurity - Ethereum Istanbul Hardfork: The Security Perspective](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IiRYSjwle02zQUmWId06Bss8GrxGyw6nQAiZdCRFEPk/)\\n- [Steve Marx - Stop Using Solidityâ€™s transfer() Now\\n  ](https://diligence.consensys.net/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/)\\n- [EIP 1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### hardcoded_gas_limits.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Bernhard Mueller (ConsenSys / MythX)\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity 0.6.4;\\n\\ninterface ICallable {\\n\\tfunction callMe() external;\\n}\\n\\ncontract HardcodedNotGood {\\n\\n    address payable _callable = 0xaAaAaAaaAaAaAaaAaAAAAAAAAaaaAaAaAaaAaaAa;\\n\\tICallable callable = ICallable(_callable);\\n\\n\\tconstructor() public payable {\\n\\t}\\n\\n    function doTransfer(uint256 amount) public {\\n        _callable.transfer(amount);\\n    }\\n\\n    function doSend(uint256 amount) public {\\n    \\t_callable.send(amount);\\n    }\\n\\n     function callLowLevel() public {\\n         _callable.call.value(0).gas(10000)(\\\"\\\");\\n     }\\n\\n     function callWithArgs() public {\\n         callable.callMe{gas: 10000}();\\n     }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n# Please note, this content is no longer actively maintained.\\n\\nThe content of the SWC registry has not been thoroughly updated since 2020.

To minimize the damage caused by such failures, it is better to isolate each external call into its own transaction that can be initiated by the recipient of the call. This is especially relevant for payments, where it is better to let users withdraw funds rather than push funds to them automatically (this also reduces the chance of problems with the gas limit).\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt is recommended to follow call best practices:\\n\\n- Avoid combining multiple calls in a single transaction, especially when calls are executed as part of a loop\\n- Always assume that external calls can fail\\n- Implement the contract logic to handle failed calls\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices - Favor pull over push for external calls](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/development-recommendations/general/external-calls/#favor-pull-over-push-for-external-calls)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### send_loop.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @source: https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/known_attacks/#dos-with-unexpected-revert\\n * @author: ConsenSys Diligence\\n * Modified by Bernhard Mueller\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity 0.4.24;\\n\\ncontract Refunder {\\n\\naddress[] private refundAddresses;\\nmapping (address => uint) public refunds;\\n\\n\\tconstructor() {\\n\\t\\trefundAddresses.push(0x79B483371E87d664cd39491b5F06250165e4b184);\\n\\t\\trefundAddresses.push(0x79B483371E87d664cd39491b5F06250165e4b185);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\t// bad\\n\\tfunction refundAll() public {\\n\\t    for(uint x; x < refundAddresses.length; x++) { // arbitrary length iteration based on how many addresses participated\\n\\t        require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]])); // doubly bad, now a single failure on send will hold up all funds\\n\\t    }\\n\\t}\\n\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n# Please note, this content is no longer actively maintained.\\n\\nThe content of the SWC registry has not been thoroughly updated since 2020.

As well as the latest release version, an\\n[Editor's draft](https://entethalliance.github.io/eta-registry/security-levels-spec.html) is available, that represents the latest work of the group developing the specification.\\n\\nGeneral guidance for developers on what to consider to ensure security, that is currently maintained, is also available through the\\n[Smart Contract Security Verification Standard (SCSVS)](https://github.com/ComposableSecurity/SCSVS).\\n\\n# Title\\n\\nCode With No Effects\\n\\n## Relationships\\n\\n- [CWE-710: Improper Adherence to Coding Standards](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/710.html)\\n- EthTrust Security Levels:\\n  - [**[Q] Code Linting**](https://entethalliance.org/specs/ethtrust-sl/#req-3-linted)\\n\\n## Description\\n\\nIn Solidity, it's possible to write code that does not produce the intended effects. Currently, the solidity compiler will not return a warning for effect-free code. This can lead to the introduction of \\\"dead\\\" code that does not properly perform an intended action.\\n\\nFor example, it's easy to miss the trailing parentheses in `msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance)(\\\"\\\");`, which could lead to a function proceeding without transferring funds to `msg.sender`. Although, this should be avoided by [checking the return value of the call](./SWC-104.md).\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nIt's important to carefully ensure that your contract works as intended. Write  unit tests to verify correct behaviour of the code.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Issue on Solidity's Github - raise an error when a statement can never have side-effects](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2707)\\n- [Issue on Solidity's Github - msg.sender.call.value(address(this).balance); should produce a warning](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7096)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### deposit_box.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract DepositBox {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Accept deposit\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'incorrect amount');\\n        // Should update user balance\\n        balance[msg.sender] == amount;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### deposit_box_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract DepositBox {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Accept deposit\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'incorrect amount');\\n        // Should update user balance\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### wallet.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract Wallet {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Deposit funds in contract\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'msg.value must be equal to amount');\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Withdraw funds from contract\\n    function withdraw(uint amount) public {\\n        require(amount <= balance[msg.sender], 'amount must be less than balance');\\n\\n        uint previousBalance = balance[msg.sender];\\n        balance[msg.sender] = previousBalance - amount;\\n\\n        // Attempt to send amount from the contract to msg.sender\\n        msg.sender.call.value(amount);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### wallet_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract Wallet {\\n    mapping(address => uint) balance;\\n\\n    // Deposit funds in contract\\n    function deposit(uint amount) public payable {\\n        require(msg.value == amount, 'msg.value must be equal to amount');\\n        balance[msg.sender] = amount;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Withdraw funds from contract\\n    function withdraw(uint amount) public {\\n        require(amount <= balance[msg.sender], 'amount must be less than balance');\\n\\n        uint previousBalance = balance[msg.sender];\\n        balance[msg.sender] = previousBalance - amount;\\n\\n        // Attempt to send amount from the contract to msg.sender\\n        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call.value(amount)(\\\"\\\");\\n        require(success, 'transfer failed');\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n- TARGET SOLIDITY CODE TO ANALYZE:\\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\\n\\ncontract CheckedCall {\\n    function withdraw(address payable _to) public {\\n        (bool success, ) = _to.call{value: 1 ether}(\\\"\\\");\\n        require(success, \\\"Transfer failed\\\");\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\\nRETURN a COMPREHENSIVE JSON ARRAY where EACH DETECTED ISSUE follows THIS STRUCTURE:\\n[\\n  {\\n    \\\"line\\\": \\\"LINE NUMBER WHERE ISSUE OCCURS\\\",\\n    \\\"token\\\": \\\"EXACT PROBLEMATIC CODE SNIPPET\\\",\\n    \\\"problem\\\": \\\"CONCISE NAME OF THE ISSUE\\\",\\n    \\\"severity\\\": \\\"low | medium | high\\\",\\n    \\\"explanation\\\": \\\"DETAILED REASON WHY THIS IS A PROBLEM INCLUDING POTENTIAL IMPACT\\\",\\n    \\\"migration\\\": \\\"CLEAR AND ACTIONABLE INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO FIX OR MITIGATE THIS ISSUE\\\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n### CHAIN OF THOUGHTS TO APPLY ###\\nFOLLOW THIS STEP-BY-STEP LOGIC TO GUIDE YOUR ANALYSIS:\\n\\n1.

Multiple inheritance introduces ambiguity called [Diamond Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance#The_diamond_problem): if two or more base contracts define the same function, which one should be called in the child contract? Solidity deals with this ambiguity by using reverse [C3 Linearization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization), which sets a priority between base contracts.\\n\\nThat way, base contracts have different priorities, so the order of inheritance matters. Neglecting inheritance order can lead to unexpected behavior.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nWhen inheriting multiple contracts, especially if they have identical functions, a developer should carefully specify inheritance in the correct order. The rule of thumb is to inherit contracts from more /general/ to more /specific/.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Smart Contract Best Practices - Complex Inheritance](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/development-recommendations/solidity-specific/complex-inheritance/)\\n- [Solidity docs - Multiple Inheritance and Linearization](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.25/contracts.html#multiple-inheritance-and-linearization)\\n- [Solidity anti-patterns: Fun with inheritance DAG abuse](https://pdaian.com/blog/solidity-anti-patterns-fun-with-inheritance-dag-abuse)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### MDTCrowdsale.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @source: https://github.com/Arachnid/uscc/blob/master/submissions-2017/philipdaian/MDTCrowdsale.sol\\n * @author: Philip Daian\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.4.25;\\n\\n//import \\\"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol\\\";\\n/**\\n * @title SafeMath\\n * @dev Math operations with safety checks that revert on error\\n */\\nlibrary SafeMath {\\n    /**\\n    * @dev Multiplies two numbers, reverts on overflow.\\n    */\\n    function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n        // Gas optimization: this is cheaper than requiring 'a' not being zero, but the\\n        // benefit is lost if 'b' is also tested.\\n        // See: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/522\\n        if (a == 0) {\\n            return 0;\\n        }\\n\\n        uint256 c = a * b;\\n        require(c / a == b);\\n\\n        return c;\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n    * @dev Integer division of two numbers truncating the quotient, reverts on division by zero.\\n    */\\n    function div(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n        // Solidity only automatically asserts when dividing by 0\\n        require(b > 0);\\n        uint256 c = a / b;\\n        // assert(a == b * c + a % b); // There is no case in which this doesn't hold\\n\\n        return c;\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n    * @dev Subtracts two numbers, reverts on overflow (i.e. if subtrahend is greater than minuend).\\n    */\\n    function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n        require(b <= a);\\n        uint256 c = a - b;\\n\\n        return c;\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n    * @dev Adds two numbers, reverts on overflow.\\n    */\\n    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n        uint256 c = a + b;\\n        require(c >= a);\\n\\n        return c;\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n    * @dev Divides two numbers and returns the remainder (unsigned integer modulo),\\n    * reverts when dividing by zero.\\n    */\\n    function mod(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n        require(b != 0);\\n        return a % b;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n//import \\\"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20Mintable.sol\\\";\\n\\n/**\\n * @title ERC20 interface\\n * @dev see https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20\\n */\\ninterface IERC20 {\\n    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);\\n\\n    function balanceOf(address who) external view returns (uint256);\\n\\n    function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256);\\n\\n    function transfer(address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool);\\n\\n    function approve(address spender, uint256 value) external returns (bool);\\n\\n    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool);\\n\\n    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);\\n\\n    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);\\n}\\n\\n/**\\n * @title Standard ERC20 token\\n *\\n * @dev Implementation of the basic standard token.\\n * https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md\\n * Originally based on code by FirstBlood: https://github.com/Firstbloodio/token/blob/master/smart_contract/FirstBloodToken.sol\\n *\\n * This implementation emits additional Approval events, allowing applications to reconstruct the allowance status for\\n * all accounts just by listening to said events.

Multiple inheritance introduces ambiguity called [Diamond Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance#The_diamond_problem): if two or more base contracts define the same function, which one should be called in the child contract? Solidity deals with this ambiguity by using reverse [C3 Linearization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization), which sets a priority between base contracts.\\n\\nThat way, base contracts have different priorities, so the order of inheritance matters. Neglecting inheritance order can lead to unexpected behavior.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nWhen inheriting multiple contracts, especially if they have identical functions, a developer should carefully specify inheritance in the correct order. The rule of thumb is to inherit contracts from more /general/ to more /specific/.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Smart Contract Best Practices - Complex Inheritance](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/development-recommendations/solidity-specific/complex-inheritance/)\\n- [Solidity docs - Multiple Inheritance and Linearization](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.25/contracts.html#multiple-inheritance-and-linearization)\\n- [Solidity anti-patterns: Fun with inheritance DAG abuse](https://pdaian.com/blog/solidity-anti-patterns-fun-with-inheritance-dag-abuse)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### MDTCrowdsale.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @source: https://github.com/Arachnid/uscc/blob/master/submissions-2017/philipdaian/MDTCrowdsale.sol\\n * @author: Philip Daian\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.4.25;\\n\\n//import \\\"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol\\\";\\n/**\\n * @title SafeMath\\n * @dev Math operations with safety checks that revert on error\\n */\\nlibrary SafeMath {\\n    /**\\n    * @dev Multiplies two numbers, reverts on overflow.\\n    */\\n    function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n        // Gas optimization: this is cheaper than requiring 'a' not being zero, but the\\n        // benefit is lost if 'b' is also tested.\\n        // See: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/522\\n        if (a == 0) {\\n            return 0;\\n        }\\n\\n        uint256 c = a * b;\\n        require(c / a == b);\\n\\n        return c;\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n    * @dev Integer division of two numbers truncating the quotient, reverts on division by zero.\\n    */\\n    function div(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n        // Solidity only automatically asserts when dividing by 0\\n        require(b > 0);\\n        uint256 c = a / b;\\n        // assert(a == b * c + a % b); // There is no case in which this doesn't hold\\n\\n        return c;\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n    * @dev Subtracts two numbers, reverts on overflow (i.e. if subtrahend is greater than minuend).\\n    */\\n    function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n        require(b <= a);\\n        uint256 c = a - b;\\n\\n        return c;\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n    * @dev Adds two numbers, reverts on overflow.\\n    */\\n    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n        uint256 c = a + b;\\n        require(c >= a);\\n\\n        return c;\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n    * @dev Divides two numbers and returns the remainder (unsigned integer modulo),\\n    * reverts when dividing by zero.\\n    */\\n    function mod(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {\\n        require(b != 0);\\n        return a % b;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n//import \\\"https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20Mintable.sol\\\";\\n\\n/**\\n * @title ERC20 interface\\n * @dev see https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20\\n */\\ninterface IERC20 {\\n    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);\\n\\n    function balanceOf(address who) external view returns (uint256);\\n\\n    function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256);\\n\\n    function transfer(address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool);\\n\\n    function approve(address spender, uint256 value) external returns (bool);\\n\\n    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool);\\n\\n    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);\\n\\n    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);\\n}\\n\\n/**\\n * @title Standard ERC20 token\\n *\\n * @dev Implementation of the basic standard token.\\n * https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md\\n * Originally based on code by FirstBlood: https://github.com/Firstbloodio/token/blob/master/smart_contract/FirstBloodToken.sol\\n *\\n * This implementation emits additional Approval events, allowing applications to reconstruct the allowance status for\\n * all accounts just by listening to said events.

It is always possible to forcibly send ether to a contract (without triggering its fallback function), using selfdestruct, or by mining to the account. In the worst case scenario this could lead to DOS conditions that might render the contract unusable.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nAvoid strict equality checks for the Ether balance in a contract.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Consensys Best Practices: Force Feeding](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/attacks/force-feeding/)\\n- [Sigmaprime: Unexpected Ether](https://blog.sigmaprime.io/solidity-security.html#ether)\\n- [Gridlock (a smart contract bug)](https://medium.com/@nmcl/gridlock-a-smart-contract-bug-73b8310608a9)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### Lockdrop.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/**\\n * @source: https://github.com/hicommonwealth/edgeware-lockdrop/blob/93ecb524c9c88d25bab36278541f190fa9e910c2/contracts/Lockdrop.sol\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\ncontract Lock {\\n    // address owner;

Since `abi.encodePacked()` packs all elements in order regardless of whether they're part of an array, you can move elements between arrays and, so long as all elements are in the same order, it will return the same encoding. In a signature verification situation, an attacker could exploit this by modifying the position of elements in a previous function call to effectively bypass authorization.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nWhen using `abi.encodePacked()`, it's crucial to ensure that a matching signature cannot be achieved using different parameters. To do so, either do not allow users access to parameters used in `abi.encodePacked()`, or use fixed length arrays. Alternatively, you can simply use `abi.encode()` instead.\\n\\nIt is also recommended that you use replay protection (see [SWC-121](./SWC-121.md)), although an attacker can still bypass this by [front-running](./SWC-114.md).\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Solidity Non-standard Packed Mode](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.3/abi-spec.html#non-standard-packed-mode)\\n- [Hash Collision Attack](https://learncryptography.com/hash-functions/hash-collision-attack)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### access_control.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Steve Marx\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\nimport \\\"./ECDSA.sol\\\";\\n\\ncontract AccessControl {\\n    using ECDSA for bytes32;\\n    mapping(address => bool) isAdmin;\\n    mapping(address => bool) isRegularUser;\\n    // Add admins and regular users.\\n    function addUsers(\\n        address[] calldata admins,\\n        address[] calldata regularUsers,\\n        bytes calldata signature\\n    )\\n        external\\n    {\\n        if (!isAdmin[msg.sender]) {\\n            // Allow calls to be relayed with an admin's signature.\\n            bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(admins, regularUsers));\\n            address signer = hash.toEthSignedMessageHash().recover(signature);\\n            require(isAdmin[signer], \\\"Only admins can add users.\\\");\\n        }\\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < admins.length; i++) {\\n            isAdmin[admins[i]] = true;\\n        }\\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < regularUsers.length; i++) {\\n            isRegularUser[regularUsers[i]] = true;\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### access_control_fixed_1.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Steve Marx\\n * Modified by Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\nimport \\\"./ECDSA.sol\\\";\\n\\ncontract AccessControl {\\n    using ECDSA for bytes32;\\n    mapping(address => bool) isAdmin;\\n    mapping(address => bool) isRegularUser;\\n    // Add a single user, either an admin or regular user.\\n    function addUser(\\n        address user,\\n        bool admin,\\n        bytes calldata signature\\n    )\\n        external\\n    {\\n        if (!isAdmin[msg.sender]) {\\n            // Allow calls to be relayed with an admin's signature.\\n            bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(user));\\n            address signer = hash.toEthSignedMessageHash().recover(signature);\\n            require(isAdmin[signer], \\\"Only admins can add users.\\\");\\n        }\\n        if (admin) {\\n            isAdmin[user] = true;\\n        } else {\\n            isRegularUser[user] = true;\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### access_control_fixed_2.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Steve Marx\\n * Modified by Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\nimport \\\"./ECDSA.sol\\\";\\n\\ncontract AccessControl {\\n    using ECDSA for bytes32;\\n    mapping(address => bool) isAdmin;\\n    mapping(address => bool) isRegularUser;\\n    // Add admins and regular users.\\n    function addUsers(\\n        // Use fixed length arrays.\\n        address[3] calldata admins,\\n        address[3] calldata regularUsers,\\n        bytes calldata signature\\n    )\\n        external\\n    {\\n        if (!isAdmin[msg.sender]) {\\n            // Allow calls to be relayed with an admin's signature.\\n            bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(admins, regularUsers));\\n            address signer = hash.toEthSignedMessageHash().recover(signature);\\n            require(isAdmin[signer], \\\"Only admins can add users.\\\");\\n        }\\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < admins.length; i++) {\\n            isAdmin[admins[i]] = true;\\n        }\\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < regularUsers.length; i++) {\\n            isRegularUser[regularUsers[i]] = true;\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n# Please note, this content is no longer actively maintained.\\n\\nThe content of the SWC registry has not been thoroughly updated since 2020.

The EVM specification defines several so-called â€˜precompiledâ€™ contracts one of them being `ecrecover` which executes the elliptic curve public key recovery. A malicious user can slightly modify the three values _v_, _r_ and _s_ to create other valid signatures. A system that performs signature verification on contract level might be susceptible to attacks if the signature is part of the signed message hash.

Since `abi.encodePacked()` packs all elements in order regardless of whether they're part of an array, you can move elements between arrays and, so long as all elements are in the same order, it will return the same encoding. In a signature verification situation, an attacker could exploit this by modifying the position of elements in a previous function call to effectively bypass authorization.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nWhen using `abi.encodePacked()`, it's crucial to ensure that a matching signature cannot be achieved using different parameters. To do so, either do not allow users access to parameters used in `abi.encodePacked()`, or use fixed length arrays. Alternatively, you can simply use `abi.encode()` instead.\\n\\nIt is also recommended that you use replay protection (see [SWC-121](./SWC-121.md)), although an attacker can still bypass this by [front-running](./SWC-114.md).\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [Solidity Non-standard Packed Mode](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.3/abi-spec.html#non-standard-packed-mode)\\n- [Hash Collision Attack](https://learncryptography.com/hash-functions/hash-collision-attack)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### access_control.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Steve Marx\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\nimport \\\"./ECDSA.sol\\\";\\n\\ncontract AccessControl {\\n    using ECDSA for bytes32;\\n    mapping(address => bool) isAdmin;\\n    mapping(address => bool) isRegularUser;\\n    // Add admins and regular users.\\n    function addUsers(\\n        address[] calldata admins,\\n        address[] calldata regularUsers,\\n        bytes calldata signature\\n    )\\n        external\\n    {\\n        if (!isAdmin[msg.sender]) {\\n            // Allow calls to be relayed with an admin's signature.\\n            bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(admins, regularUsers));\\n            address signer = hash.toEthSignedMessageHash().recover(signature);\\n            require(isAdmin[signer], \\\"Only admins can add users.\\\");\\n        }\\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < admins.length; i++) {\\n            isAdmin[admins[i]] = true;\\n        }\\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < regularUsers.length; i++) {\\n            isRegularUser[regularUsers[i]] = true;\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### access_control_fixed_1.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Steve Marx\\n * Modified by Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\nimport \\\"./ECDSA.sol\\\";\\n\\ncontract AccessControl {\\n    using ECDSA for bytes32;\\n    mapping(address => bool) isAdmin;\\n    mapping(address => bool) isRegularUser;\\n    // Add a single user, either an admin or regular user.\\n    function addUser(\\n        address user,\\n        bool admin,\\n        bytes calldata signature\\n    )\\n        external\\n    {\\n        if (!isAdmin[msg.sender]) {\\n            // Allow calls to be relayed with an admin's signature.\\n            bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(user));\\n            address signer = hash.toEthSignedMessageHash().recover(signature);\\n            require(isAdmin[signer], \\\"Only admins can add users.\\\");\\n        }\\n        if (admin) {\\n            isAdmin[user] = true;\\n        } else {\\n            isRegularUser[user] = true;\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### access_control_fixed_2.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\n/*\\n * @author: Steve Marx\\n * Modified by Kaden Zipfel\\n */\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.5.0;\\n\\nimport \\\"./ECDSA.sol\\\";\\n\\ncontract AccessControl {\\n    using ECDSA for bytes32;\\n    mapping(address => bool) isAdmin;\\n    mapping(address => bool) isRegularUser;\\n    // Add admins and regular users.\\n    function addUsers(\\n        // Use fixed length arrays.\\n        address[3] calldata admins,\\n        address[3] calldata regularUsers,\\n        bytes calldata signature\\n    )\\n        external\\n    {\\n        if (!isAdmin[msg.sender]) {\\n            // Allow calls to be relayed with an admin's signature.\\n            bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(admins, regularUsers));\\n            address signer = hash.toEthSignedMessageHash().recover(signature);\\n            require(isAdmin[signer], \\\"Only admins can add users.\\\");\\n        }\\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < admins.length; i++) {\\n            isAdmin[admins[i]] = true;\\n        }\\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < regularUsers.length; i++) {\\n            isRegularUser[regularUsers[i]] = true;\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n# Please note, this content is no longer actively maintained.\\n\\nThe content of the SWC registry has not been thoroughly updated since 2020.

The EVM specification defines several so-called â€˜precompiledâ€™ contracts one of them being `ecrecover` which executes the elliptic curve public key recovery. A malicious user can slightly modify the three values _v_, _r_ and _s_ to create other valid signatures. A system that performs signature verification on contract level might be susceptible to attacks if the signature is part of the signed message hash. Valid signatures could be created by a malicious user to replay previously signed messages.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nA signature should never be included into a signed message hash to check if previously messages have been processed by the contract.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n[Bitcoin Transaction Malleability](https://eklitzke.org/bitcoin-transaction-malleability)\\n[CTF - Challenge](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x0daabce0a1261b582e0d949ebca9dff4c22c88ef#code)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### transaction_malleablity.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\\n\\ncontract transaction_malleablity{\\n  mapping(address => uint256) balances;\\n  mapping(bytes32 => bool) signatureUsed;\\n\\n  constructor(address[] owners, uint[] init){\\n    require(owners.length == init.length);\\n    for(uint i=0;

Using them leads to reduced code quality. With new major versions of the Solidity compiler, deprecated functions and operators may result in side effects and compile errors.\\n\\n## Remediation\\n\\nSolidity provides alternatives to the deprecated constructions. Most of them are aliases, thus replacing old constructions will not break current behavior. For example, `sha3` can be replaced with `keccak256`.\\n\\n| Deprecated              | Alternative             |\\n| ----------------------- | ----------------------- |\\n| `suicide(address)`      | `selfdestruct(address)` |\\n| `block.blockhash(uint)` | `blockhash(uint)`       |\\n| `sha3(...)`             | `keccak256(...)`        |\\n| `callcode(...)`         | `delegatecall(...)`     |\\n| `throw`                 | `revert()`              |\\n| `msg.gas`               | `gasleft`               |\\n| `constant`              | `view`                  |\\n| `var`                   | corresponding type name |\\n\\n## References\\n\\n- [List of global variables and functions, as of Solidity 0.4.25](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.25/miscellaneous.html#global-variables)\\n- [Error handling: Assert, Require, Revert and Exceptions](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.25/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions)\\n- [View functions](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.25/contracts.html#view-functions)\\n- [Untyped declaration is deprecated as of Solidity 0.4.20](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.4.20)\\n- [Solidity compiler changelog](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases)\\n\\n## Samples\\n\\n### deprecated_simple.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\\n\\ncontract DeprecatedSimple {\\n\\n    // Do everything that's deprecated, then commit suicide.\\n\\n    function useDeprecated() public constant {\\n\\n        bytes32 blockhash = block.blockhash(0);\\n        bytes32 hashofhash = sha3(blockhash);\\n\\n        uint gas = msg.gas;\\n\\n        if (gas == 0) {\\n            throw;\\n        }\\n\\n        address(this).callcode();\\n\\n        var a = [1,2,3];\\n\\n        var (x, y, z) = (false, \\\"test\\\", 0);\\n\\n        suicide(address(0));\\n    }\\n\\n    function () public {}\\n\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n### deprecated_simple_fixed.sol\\n\\n```solidity\\npragma solidity ^0.4.24;\\n\\ncontract DeprecatedSimpleFixed {\\n\\n    function useDeprecatedFixed() public view {\\n\\n        bytes32 bhash = blockhash(0);\\n        bytes32 hashofhash = keccak256(bhash);\\n\\n        uint gas = gasleft();\\n\\n        if (gas == 0) {\\n            revert();\\n        }\\n\\n        address(this).delegatecall();\\n\\n        uint8[3] memory a = [1,2,3];\\n\\n        (bool x, string memory y, uint8 z) = (false, \\\"test\\\", 0);\\n\\n        selfdestruct(address(0));\\n    }\\n\\n    function () external {}\\n\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n\\n- TARGET SOLIDITY CODE TO ANALYZE:\\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\\n\\ncontract UpdatedHash {\\n    function test(bytes memory a, bytes memory b) public pure returns (bool) {\\n        return keccak256(abi.encode(a, b)) == keccak256(abi.encode(b, a)); // fixed\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n### OUTPUT FORMAT ###\\nRETURN a COMPREHENSIVE JSON ARRAY where EACH DETECTED ISSUE follows THIS STRUCTURE:\\n[\\n  {\\n    \\\"line\\\": \\\"LINE NUMBER WHERE ISSUE OCCURS\\\",\\n    \\\"token\\\": \\\"EXACT PROBLEMATIC CODE SNIPPET\\\",\\n    \\\"problem\\\": \\\"CONCISE NAME OF THE ISSUE\\\",\\n    \\\"severity\\\": \\\"low | medium | high\\\",\\n    \\\"explanation\\\": \\\"DETAILED REASON WHY THIS IS A PROBLEM INCLUDING POTENTIAL IMPACT\\\",\\n    \\\"migration\\\": \\\"CLEAR AND ACTIONABLE INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO FIX OR MITIGATE THIS ISSUE\\\"\\n  }\\n]\\n\\n### CHAIN OF THOUGHTS TO APPLY ###\\nFOLLOW THIS STEP-BY-STEP LOGIC TO GUIDE YOUR ANALYSIS:\\n\\n1.
